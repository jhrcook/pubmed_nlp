As a member of the mitogen‑activated protein kinase family, ERK1/2 (extracellular signal‑regulated protein kinase) has an important role in delivering extracellular signals to the nucleus, and these signals regulate the cell cycle, cell proliferation and cell development. Previous studies demonstrated that ERK1/2 is closely associated with cell aging; however other previous studies suggested that ERK1/2 exerts an opposite effect on aging models and target proteins, even within the same cell model. Recent studies demonstrated that the effect of ERK1/2 on aging is likely associated with its target proteins and regulators, negative feedback loops, phosphorylated ERK1/2 factors and ERK1/2 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The present review aims to examine the mechanism of ERK1/2 and discuss its role in cellular outcomes and novel drug development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tosi, Diego</author><author>Pérez-Gracia, Esther</author><author>Atis, Salima</author><author>Vié, Nadia</author><author>Combès, Eve</author><author>Gabanou, Mélissa</author><author>Larbouret, Christel</author><author>Jarlier, Marta</author><author>Mollevi, Caroline</author><author>Torro, Adeline</author><author>Del Rio, Maguy</author><author>Martineau, Pierre</author><author>Gongora, Céline</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rational development of synergistic combinations of chemotherapy and molecular targeted agents for colorectal cancer treatment.</title><secondary-title>BMC cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>812</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Colorectal cancer</keyword><keyword>Drug combinations</keyword><keyword>Irinotecan</keyword><keyword>Phosphokinome</keyword><keyword>Synergistic effect</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30103709</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12885-018-4712-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - Tosi et al. - Unknown - Rational development of synergistic combinations of chemotherapy and molecular targeted agents for col.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-018-4712-z</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30103709</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6090616</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND The irinotecan-induced phosphokinome changes in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells were used to guide the selection of targeted agents to be tested in combination with irinotecan. METHODS Phosphokinome profiling with peptide arrays of tumour samples from nude mice xenografted with HT29 cells and treated or not with an effective dose of irinotecan was used to identify signalling pathways activated by irinotecan treatment. Then, drugs targeting these pathways were combined in vitro with irinotecan to test potential synergistic effect. The interactions between these drug combinations were assessed by a dose matrix approach. Confirmation of the most potential combination has been confirmed in vivo in xenografted mice. RESULTS Irinotecan induced in vivo the activation of AKT and MEK1 phosphorylation. The dose matrix approach showed that BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor) and MEK162 (MEK inhibitor) are synergistic in vitro and in vivo with a cytostatic and cytotoxic effect, while combination of BKM120 and irinotecan or MEK162 and irinotecan are only additive or even antagonistic. However, the triple combination of SN38, BKM120 and MEK162 showed a better synergistic effect that BKM120 and MEK162, indicating that the cells need to inhibit both AKT and ERK pathways to become more sensitive to irinotecan-based chemotherapies. CONCLUSION Analysis of chemotherapy-induced phosphokinome changes helps to elucidate the mechanisms of drug resistance and to guide the selection of targets for combination therapies with synergistic activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Little, Annette S</author><author>Balmanno, Kathryn</author><author>Sale, Matthew J</author><author>Newman, Scott</author><author>Dry, Jonathan R</author><author>Hampson, Mark</author><author>Edwards, Paul A W</author><author>Smith, Paul D</author><author>Cook, Simon J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Amplification of the driving oncogene, KRAS or BRAF, underpins acquired resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>Science signaling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science signaling</full-title></periodical><pages>ra17</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>166</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21447798</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/scisignal.2001752</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - Little et al. - Unknown - Amplification of the Driving Oncogene, KRAS or BRAF, Underpins Acquired Resistance to MEK12 Inhibito.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.SCIENCESIGNALING.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21447798</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The acquisition of resistance to protein kinase inhibitors is a growing problem in cancer treatment. We modeled acquired resistance to the MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2) inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) in colorectal cancer cell lines harboring mutations in BRAF (COLO205 and HT29 lines) or KRAS (HCT116 and LoVo lines). AZD6244-resistant derivatives were refractory to AZD6244-induced cell cycle arrest and death and exhibited a marked increase in ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2) pathway signaling and cyclin D1 abundance when assessed in the absence of inhibitor. Genomic sequencing revealed no acquired mutations in MEK1 or MEK2, the primary target of AZD6244. Rather, resistant lines showed a marked up-regulation of their respective driving oncogenes, BRAF(600E) or KRAS(13D), due to intrachromosomal amplification. Inhibition of BRAF reversed resistance to AZD6244 in COLO205 cells, which suggested that combined inhibition of MEK1/2 and BRAF may reduce the likelihood of acquired resistance in tumors with BRAF(600E). Knockdown of KRAS reversed AZD6244 resistance in HCT116 cells as well as reduced the activation of ERK1/2 and protein kinase B; however, the combined inhibition of ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling had little effect on AZD6244 resistance, suggesting that additional KRAS effector pathways contribute to this process. Microarray analysis identified increased expression of an 18-gene signature previously identified as reflecting MEK1/2 pathway output in resistant cells. Thus, amplification of the driving oncogene (BRAF(600E) or KRAS(13D)) can drive acquired resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors by increasing signaling through the ERK1/2 pathway. However, up-regulation of KRAS(13D) leads to activation of multiple KRAS effector pathways, underlining the therapeutic challenge posed by KRAS mutations. These results may have implications for the use of combination therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Duncan, James S</author><author>Whittle, Martin C</author><author>Nakamura, Kazuhiro</author><author>Abell, Amy N</author><author>Midland, Alicia A</author><author>Zawistowski, Jon S</author><author>Johnson, Nancy L</author><author>Granger, Deborah A</author><author>Jordan, Nicole Vincent</author><author>Darr, David B</author><author>Usary, Jerry</author><author>Kuan, Pei-Fen</author><author>Smalley, David M</author><author>Major, Ben</author><author>He, Xiaping</author><author>Hoadley, Katherine A</author><author>Zhou, Bing</author><author>Sharpless, Norman E</author><author>Perou, Charles M</author><author>Kim, William Y</author><author>Gomez, Shawn M</author><author>Chen, Xin</author><author>Jin, Jian</author><author>Frye, Stephen V</author><author>Earp, H.

Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we assessed kinome activity in response to MEK inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and genetically engineered mice (GEMMs). MEK inhibition caused acute ERK activity loss, resulting in rapid c-Myc degradation that induced expression and activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RNAi knockdown of ERK or c-Myc mimicked RTK induction by MEK inhibitors, and prevention of proteasomal c-Myc degradation blocked kinome reprogramming. MEK inhibitor-induced RTK stimulation overcame MEK2 inhibition, but not MEK1 inhibition, reactivating ERK and producing drug resistance. The C3Tag GEMM for TNBC similarly induced RTKs in response to MEK inhibition. The inhibitor-induced RTK profile suggested a kinase inhibitor combination therapy that produced GEMM tumor apoptosis and regression where single agents were ineffective. This approach defines mechanisms of drug resistance, allowing rational design of combination therapies for cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wee, Susan</author><author>Jagani, Zainab</author><author>Xiang, Kay Xiaoqin</author><author>Loo, Alice</author><author>Dorsch, Marion</author><author>Yao, Yung-Mae</author><author>Sellers, William R</author><author>Lengauer, Christoph</author><author>Stegmeier, Frank</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PI3K pathway activation mediates resistance to MEK inhibitors in KRAS mutant cancers.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>4286-93</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19401449</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4765</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Wee et al. - Cancer Res - PI3K Pathway Activation Mediates Resistance to MEK Inhibitors in KRAS Mutant Cancers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19401449</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The RAS pathway is one of the most frequently deregulated pathways in cancer. RAS signals through multiple effector pathways, including the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling cascades. The oncogenic potential of these effector pathways is illustrated by the frequent occurrence of activating mutations in BRAF and PIK3CA as well as loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K. Previous studies have found that whereas BRAF mutant cancers are highly sensitive to MEK inhibition, RAS mutant cancers exhibit a more variable response. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneous response remain unclear. In this study, we show that PI3K pathway activation strongly influences the sensitivity of RAS mutant cells to MEK inhibitors. Activating mutations in PIK3CA reduce the sensitivity to MEK inhibition, whereas PTEN mutations seem to cause complete resistance. We further show that down-regulation of PIK3CA resensitizes cells with co-occurring KRAS and PIK3CA mutations to MEK inhibition. At the molecular level, the dual inhibition of both pathways seems to be required for complete inhibition of the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin effector pathway and results in the induction of cell death. Finally, we show that whereas inactivation of either the MEK or PI3K pathway leads to partial tumor growth inhibition, targeted inhibition of both pathways is required to achieve tumor stasis. Our study provides molecular insights that help explain the heterogeneous response of KRAS mutant cancers to MEK pathway inhibition and presents a strong rationale for the clinical testing of combination MEK and PI3K targeted therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sarkisian, Christopher J</author><author>Keister, Blaine A</author><author>Stairs, Douglas B</author><author>Boxer, Robert B</author><author>Moody, Susan E</author><author>Chodosh, Lewis A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dose-dependent oncogene-induced senescence in vivo and its evasion during mammary tumorigenesis.</title><secondary-title>Nature cell biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature cell biology</full-title></periodical><pages>493-505</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17450133</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncb1567</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Sarkisian et al. - NATURE CELL BIOLOGY - Dose-dependent oncogene-induced senescence in vivo and its evasion during mammary tumori.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb1567.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17450133</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Activating Ras mutations can induce either proliferation or senescence depending on the cellular context. To determine whether Ras activation has context-dependent effects in the mammary gland, we generated doxycycline-inducible transgenic mice that permit Ras activation to be titrated. Low levels of Ras activation - similar to those found in non-transformed mouse tissues expressing endogenous oncogenic Kras2 - stimulate cellular proliferation and mammary epithelial hyperplasias. In contrast, high levels of Ras activation - similar to those found in tumours bearing endogenous Kras2 mutations - induce cellular senescence that is Ink4a-Arf- dependent and irreversible following Ras downregulation. Chronic low-level Ras induction results in tumour formation, but only after the spontaneous upregulation of activated Ras and evasion of senescence checkpoints. Thus, high-level, but not low-level, Ras activation activates tumour suppressor pathways and triggers an irreversible senescent growth arrest in vivo. We suggest a three-stage model for Ras-induced tumorigenesis consisting of an initial activating Ras mutation, overexpression of the activated Ras allele and, finally, evasion of p53-Ink4a-Arf-dependent senescence checkpoints.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vandal, Guillaume</author><author>Geiling, Benjamin</author><author>Dankort, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ras effector mutant expression suggest a negative regulator inhibits lung tumor formation.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e84745</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>2011700876</isbn><accession-num>24489653</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0084745</electronic-resource-num><notes>Under-powered study - DO NOT USE!</notes><research-notes>Under-powered study - DO NOT USE!</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - Vandal, Geiling, Dankort - Unknown - Ras Effector Mutant Expression Suggest a Negative Regulator Inhibits Lung Tumor Formation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.plosone.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24489653</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3904846</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Lung cancer is currently the most deadly malignancy in industrialized countries and accounts for 18% of all cancer-related deaths worldwide. Over 70% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are diagnosed at a late stage, with a 5-year survival below 10%. KRAS and the EGFR are frequently mutated in NSCLC and while targeted therapies for patients with EGFR mutations exist, oncogenic KRAS is thus far not druggable. KRAS activates multiple signalling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway, the Raf-Mek-Erk pathway and the RalGDS/Ral pathway. Lung-specific expression of BrafV600E, the most prevalent BRAF mutation found in human tumors, results in Raf-Mek-Erk pathway activation and in the formation of benign adenomas that undergo widespread senescence in a Cre-activated Braf mouse model (Braf(CA)). However, oncogenic KRAS expression in mice induces adenocarcinomas, suggesting additional KRAS-activated pathways cooperate with sustained RAF-MEK-ERK signalling to bypass the oncogene-induced senescence proliferation arrest. To determine which KRAS effectors were responsible for tumor progression, we created four effector domain mutants (S35, G37, E38 and C40) in G12V-activated KRAS and expressed these alone or with BrafV600E in mouse lungs... The S35 and E38 mutants bind to Raf proteins but not PI3K or RalGDS; the G37 mutant binds to RalGDS and not Raf or PI3K and the C40 mutant is specific to PI3K. We designed lentiviral vectors to code for Cre recombinase along with KRAS mutants (V12, V12/S35, V12/G37, V12/E38 or V12/C40) or EGFP as a negative control.. These lentiviruses were used to infect Braf(CA) and wild-type mice. Surprisingly there was a significant decrease in tumor number and penetrance with each KRAS effector domain mutant relative to controls, suggesting that KRAS directly activates effectors with tumor suppressive functions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kennedy, Alyssa L</author><author>Morton, Jennifer P</author><author>Manoharan, Indrani</author><author>Nelson, David M</author><author>Jamieson, Nigel B</author><author>Pawlikowski, Jeff S</author><author>McBryan, Tony</author><author>Doyle, Brendan</author><author>McKay, Colin</author><author>Oien, Karin A</author><author>Enders, Greg H</author><author>Zhang, Rugang</author><author>Sansom, Owen J</author><author>Adams, Peter D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Activation of the PIK3CA/AKT pathway suppresses senescence induced by an activated RAS oncogene to promote tumorigenesis.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cell</full-title></periodical><pages>36-49</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21474066</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molcel.2011.02.020</electronic-resource-num><notes>hyperactive Akt1 and KRAS G12V show weaker signs of senescence than KRAS G12V does, alone</notes><research-notes>hyperactive Akt1 and KRAS G12V show weaker signs of senescence than KRAS G12V does, alone</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Kennedy et al. - Molecular Cell - Article Activation of the PIK3CAAKT Pathway Suppresses Senescence Induced by an Activated RAS O.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272198/1-s2.0-S1097276511X00072/1-s2.0-S109727651100133X/main.pdf?x-amz-security-token=AgoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEKj%252F%252F%252F%252F%252F%252F%252F%252F%252F%252FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJGMEQCIAzTcdrru25mwjEOBKXNIEhzjuLThO4aRUrr4wc7</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>Mutations in both RAS and the PTEN/PIK3CA/AKT signaling module are found in the same human tumors. PIK3CA and AKT are downstream effectors of RAS, and the selective advantage conferred by mutation of two genes in the same pathway is unclear. Based on a comparative molecular analysis, we show that activated PIK3CA/AKT is a weaker inducer of senescence than is activated RAS. Moreover, concurrent activation of RAS and PIK3CA/AKT impairs RAS-induced senescence. In vivo, bypass of RAS-induced senescence by activated PIK3CA/AKT correlates with accelerated tumorigenesis. Thus, not all oncogenes are equally potent inducers of senescence, and, paradoxically, a weak inducer of senescence (PIK3CA/AKT) can be dominant over a strong inducer of senescence (RAS). For tumor growth, one selective advantage of concurrent mutation of RAS and PTEN/PIK3CA/AKT is suppression of RAS-induced senescence. Evidence is presented that this new understanding can be exploited in rational development and targeted application of prosenescence cancer therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Le Tourneau, Christophe</author><author>Delord, Jean-Pierre</author><author>Gonçalves, Anthony</author><author>Gavoille, Céline</author><author>Dubot, Coraline</author><author>Isambert, Nicolas</author><author>Campone, Mario</author><author>Trédan, Olivier</author><author>Massiani, Marie-Ange</author><author>Mauborgne, Cécile</author><author>Armanet, Sebastien</author><author>Servant, Nicolas</author><author>Bièche, Ivan</author><author>Bernard, Virginie</author><author>Gentien, David</author><author>Jezequel, Pascal</author><author>Attignon, Valéry</author><author>Boyault, Sandrine</author><author>Vincent-Salomon, Anne</author><author>Servois, Vincent</author><author>Sablin, Marie-Paule</author><author>Kamal, Maud</author><author>Paoletti, Xavier</author><author>SHIVA investigators</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecularly targeted therapy based on tumour molecular profiling versus conventional therapy for advanced cancer (SHIVA): a multicentre, open-label, proof-of-concept, randomised, controlled phase 2 trial.</title><secondary-title>The Lancet.

These results have led to increased off-label use of molecularly targeted agents on the basis of identified molecular alterations. We assessed the efficacy of several molecularly targeted agents marketed in France, which were chosen on the basis of tumour molecular profiling but used outside their indications, in patients with advanced cancer for whom standard-of-care therapy had failed. METHODS The open-label, randomised, controlled phase 2 SHIVA trial was done at eight French academic centres. We included adult patients with any kind of metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care, provided they had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, disease that was accessible for a biopsy or resection of a metastatic site, and at least one measurable lesion. The molecular profile of each patient's tumour was established with a mandatory biopsy of a metastatic tumour and large-scale genomic testing. We only included patients for whom a molecular alteration was identified within one of three molecular pathways (hormone receptor, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAF/MEK), which could be matched to one of ten regimens including 11 available molecularly targeted agents (erlotinib, lapatinib plus trastuzumab, sorafenib, imatinib, dasatinib, vemurafenib, everolimus, abiraterone, letrozole, tamoxifen). We randomly assigned these patients (1:1) to receive a matched molecularly targeted agent (experimental group) or treatment at physician's choice (control group) by central block randomisation (blocks of size six). Randomisation was done centrally with a web-based response system and was stratified according to the Royal Marsden Hospital prognostic score (0 or 1 vs 2 or 3) and the altered molecular pathway. Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation. Treatments in both groups were given in accordance with the approved product information and standard practice protocols at each institution and were continued until evidence of disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, which was not assessed by independent central review. We assessed safety in any patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01771458. FINDINGS Between Oct 4, 2012, and July 11, 2014, we screened 741 patients with any tumour type. 293 (40%) patients had at least one molecular alteration matching one of the 10 available regimens. At the time of data cutoff, Jan 20, 2015, 195 (26%) patients had been randomly assigned, with 99 in the experimental group and 96 in the control group. All patients in the experimental group started treatment, as did 92 in the control group. Two patients in the control group received a molecularly targeted agent: both were included in their assigned group for efficacy analyses, the patient who received an agent that was allowed in the experimental group was included in the experimental group for the purposes of safety analyses, while the other patient, who received a molecularly targeted agent and chemotherapy, was kept in the control group for safety analyses. Median follow-up was 11·3 months (IQR 5·8-11·6) in the experimental group and 11·3 months (8·1-11·6) in the control group at the time of the primary analysis of progression-free survival. Median progression-free survival was 2·3 months (95% CI 1·7-3·8) in the experimental group versus 2·0 months (1·8-2·1) in the control group (hazard ratio 0·88, 95% CI 0·65-1·19, p=0·41). In the safety population, 43 (43%) of 100 patients treated with a molecularly targeted agent and 32 (35%) of 91 patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy had grade 3-4 adverse events (p=0·30). INTERPRETATION The use of molecularly targeted agents outside their indications does not improve progression-free survival compared with treatment at physician's choice in heavily pretreated patients with cancer. Off-label use of molecularly targeted agents should be discouraged, but enrolment in clinical trials should be encouraged to assess predictive biomarkers of efficacy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mullard, Asher</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Off-label targeted cancer drugs fail in first randomized trial.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

We evaluated the PFS ratio from patients who cross-over in the SHIVA trial. Patients and methods The primary end point of the SHIVA trial was to compare PFS on molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) based on tumor molecular profiling and treatment at physician's choice (TPC) in patients with any kind of cancer who had failed standard-of-care therapy. The experimental treatment included only marketed MTAs given outside their indications according to a pre-specified treatment algorithm. Patients were allowed to cross-over at disease progression in both arms. Response was evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 at randomization and at cross-over. We evaluated the ratio of PFS on MTA (PFSMTA) to PFS on TPC (PFSTPC) in patients who crossed-over. Results Among 741 patients enrolled in the SHIVA trial, 197 were randomized, and 95 crossed-over, including 70 patients from the TPC to the MTA arm and 25 patients from the MTA to the TPC arm. Two patients crossed-over in the TPC arm without disease progression. The PFSMTA/PFSTPC ratio exceeded 1.3 in 37% of patients who crossed-over from the TPC to the MTA arm. The PFSMTA/PFSTPC ratio exceeded 1.3 in 61% of patients who crossed-over from the MTA arm to the TPC arm. Conclusions The cross-over analysis of the SHIVA trial identified 37% of patients who crossed-over from TPC to MTA with a PFSMTA/PFSTPC ratio exceeding 1.3.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hyman, David M</author><author>Puzanov, Igor</author><author>Subbiah, Vivek</author><author>Faris, Jason E</author><author>Chau, Ian</author><author>Blay, Jean-Yves</author><author>Wolf, Jürgen</author><author>Raje, Noopur S</author><author>Diamond, Eli L</author><author>Hollebecque, Antoine</author><author>Gervais, Radj</author><author>Elez-Fernandez, Maria Elena</author><author>Italiano, Antoine</author><author>Hofheinz, Ralf-Dieter</author><author>Hidalgo, Manuel</author><author>Chan, Emily</author><author>Schuler, Martin</author><author>Lasserre, Susan Frances</author><author>Makrutzki, Martina</author><author>Sirzen, Florin</author><author>Veronese, Maria Luisa</author><author>Tabernero, Josep</author><author>Baselga, José</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vemurafenib in Multiple Nonmelanoma Cancers with BRAF V600 Mutations.</title><secondary-title>The New England journal of medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The New England journal of medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>726-36</pages><volume>373</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26287849</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMoa1502309</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Sanchinarro et al. - N Engl J Med - Vemurafenib in Multiple Nonmelanoma Cancers with BRAF V600 Mutations.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1502309?articleTools=true</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26287849</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4971773</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND BRAF V600 mutations occur in various nonmelanoma cancers. We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 &quot;basket&quot; study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers. METHODS We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma. CONCLUSIONS BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis. The histologic context is an important determinant of response in BRAF V600-mutated cancers. (Funded by F.

METHODS We conducted a phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine in 675 patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary end points were rates of overall and progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the response rate, response duration, and safety. A final analysis was planned after 196 deaths and an interim analysis after 98 deaths. RESULTS At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78 to 89) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56 to 73) in the dacarbazine group. In the interim analysis for overall survival and final analysis for progression-free survival, vemurafenib was associated with a relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of either death or disease progression, as compared with dacarbazine (P&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). After review of the interim analysis by an independent data and safety monitoring board, crossover from dacarbazine to vemurafenib was recommended. Response rates were 48% for vemurafenib and 5% for dacarbazine. Common adverse events associated with vemurafenib were arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia, keratoacanthoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity, nausea, and diarrhea; 38% of patients required dose modification because of toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS Vemurafenib produced improved rates of overall and progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation.

However, colon cancer patients harbouring the same BRAF(V600E) oncogenic lesion have poor prognosis and show only a very limited response to this drug. To investigate the cause of the limited therapeutic effect of PLX4032 in BRAF(V600E) mutant colon tumours, here we performed an RNA-interference-based genetic screen in human cells to search for kinases whose knockdown synergizes with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We report that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) shows strong synergy with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We find in multiple BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers that inhibition of EGFR by the antibody drug cetuximab or the small-molecule drugs gefitinib or erlotinib is strongly synergistic with BRAF(V600E) inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that BRAF(V600E) inhibition causes a rapid feedback activation of EGFR, which supports continued proliferation in the presence of BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Melanoma cells express low levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this feedback activation. Consistent with this, we find that ectopic expression of EGFR in melanoma cells is sufficient to cause resistance to PLX4032. Our data suggest that BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers (approximately 8-10% of all colon cancers), for which there are currently no targeted treatment options available, might benefit from combination therapy consisting of BRAF and EGFR inhibitors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Remy, Elisabeth</author><author>Rebouissou, Sandra</author><author>Chaouiya, Claudine</author><author>Zinovyev, Andrei</author><author>Radvanyi, François</author><author>Calzone, Laurence</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Modeling Approach to Explain Mutually Exclusive and Co-Occurring Genetic Alterations in Bladder Tumorigenesis.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>4042-52</pages><volume>75</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26238783</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-0602</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Remy et al. - Unknown - Integrated Systems and Technologies Mathematical Oncology A Modeling Approach to Explain Mutually Exclusi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26238783</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Relationships between genetic alterations, such as co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity, are often observed in cancer, where their understanding may provide new insights into etiology and clinical management. In this study, we combined statistical analyses and computational modeling to explain patterns of genetic alterations seen in 178 patients with bladder tumors (either muscle-invasive or non-muscle-invasive). A statistical analysis on frequently altered genes identified pair associations, including co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity. Focusing on genetic alterations of protein-coding genes involved in growth factor receptor signaling, cell cycle, and apoptosis entry, we complemented this analysis with a literature search to focus on nine pairs of genetic alterations of our dataset, with subsequent verification in three other datasets available publicly. To understand the reasons and contexts of these patterns of associations while accounting for the dynamics of associated signaling pathways, we built a logical model. This model was validated first on published mutant mice data, then used to study patterns and to draw conclusions on counter-intuitive observations, allowing one to formulate predictions about conditions where combining genetic alterations benefits tumorigenesis. For example, while CDKN2A homozygous deletions occur in a context of FGFR3-activating mutations, our model suggests that additional PIK3CA mutation or p21CIP deletion would greatly favor invasiveness. Furthermore, the model sheds light on the temporal orders of gene alterations, for example, showing how mutual exclusivity of FGFR3 and TP53 mutations is interpretable if FGFR3 is mutated first. Overall, our work shows how to predict combinations of the major gene alterations leading to invasiveness through two main progression pathways in bladder cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cisowski, Jaroslaw</author><author>Bergo, Martin O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What makes oncogenes mutually exclusive?</title><secondary-title>Small GTPases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Small GTPases</full-title></periodical><pages>187-192</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>RAF</keyword><keyword>RAS</keyword><keyword>mutual exclusivity</keyword><keyword>oncogene</keyword><keyword>senescence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>27416373</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/21541248.2016.1212689</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Cisowski, Bergo - Unknown - What makes oncogenes mutually exclusive.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1080/21541248.2016.1212689</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27416373</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5584735</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>Cancer is driven by mutations in genes whose products participate in major signaling pathways that fuel cell proliferation and survival. It is easy to assume that the more of these so-called driver mutations a tumor accumulates, the faster it progresses. However, this does not appear to be the case: Data from large-scale genome sequencing studies indicate that mutations in driver oncogenes often are mutually exclusive. The mechanisms underlying the mutual exclusivity of oncogenes are not completely understood, but recent reports suggest that the mechanisms may depend on the tumor type, and the nature of interacting oncogenes. Here we discuss our recent findings that the oncogenes KRASG12D and BRAFV600E are mutually exclusive in lung cancer in mouse models because their coexpression leads to oncogene-induced senescence.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Szczurek, Ewa</author><author>Beerenwinkel, Niko</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling mutual exclusivity of cancer mutations.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1003503</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24675718</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003503</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Szczurek, Beerenwinkel - PLoS Comput Biol - Modeling Mutual Exclusivity of Cancer Mutations.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.ploscompbiol.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675718</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3967923</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In large collections of tumor samples, it has been observed that sets of genes that are commonly involved in the same cancer pathways tend not to occur mutated together in the same patient. Such gene sets form mutually exclusive patterns of gene alterations in cancer genomic data. Computational approaches that detect mutually exclusive gene sets, rank and test candidate alteration patterns by rewarding the number of samples the pattern covers and by punishing its impurity, i.e., additional alterations that violate strict mutual exclusivity. However, the extant approaches do not account for possible observation errors. In practice, false negatives and especially false positives can severely bias evaluation and ranking of alteration patterns. To address these limitations, we develop a fully probabilistic, generative model of mutual exclusivity, explicitly taking coverage, impurity, as well as error rates into account, and devise efficient algorithms for parameter estimation and pattern ranking. Based on this model, we derive a statistical test of mutual exclusivity by comparing its likelihood to the null model that assumes independent gene alterations. Using extensive simulations, the new test is shown to be more powerful than a permutation test applied previously. When applied to detect mutual exclusivity patterns in glioblastoma and in pan-cancer data from twelve tumor types, we identify several significant patterns that are biologically relevant, most of which would not be detected by previous approaches. Our statistical modeling framework of mutual exclusivity provides increased flexibility and power to detect cancer pathways from genomic alteration data in the presence of noise. A summary of this paper appears in the proceedings of the RECOMB 2014 conference, April 2-5.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hornshøj, Henrik</author><author>Nielsen, Morten Muhlig</author><author>Sinnott-Armstrong, Nicholas A</author><author>Świtnicki, Michał P</author><author>Juul, Malene</author><author>Madsen, Tobias</author><author>Sallari, Richard</author><author>Kellis, Manolis</author><author>Ørntoft, Torben</author><author>Hobolth, Asger</author><author>Pedersen, Jakob Skou</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pan-cancer screen for mutations in non-coding elements with conservation and cancer specificity reveals correlations with expression and survival.</title><secondary-title>NPJ genomic medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NPJ genomic medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><volume>3</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29354286</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41525-017-0040-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Hornshøj et al. - npj Genomic Medicine - Pan-cancer screen for mutations in non-coding elements with conservation and cancer spe.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/npjgenmed</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29354286</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5765157</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancer develops by accumulation of somatic driver mutations, which impact cellular function. Mutations in non-coding regulatory regions can now be studied genome-wide and further characterized by correlation with gene expression and clinical outcome to identify driver candidates. Using a new two-stage procedure, called ncDriver, we first screened 507 ICGC whole-genomes from 10 cancer types for non-coding elements, in which mutations are both recurrent and have elevated conservation or cancer specificity. This identified 160 significant non-coding elements, including the TERT promoter, a well-known non-coding driver element, as well as elements associated with known cancer genes and regulatory genes (e.g., PAX5, TOX3, PCF11, MAPRE3). However, in some significant elements, mutations appear to stem from localized mutational processes rather than recurrent positive selection in some cases. To further characterize the driver potential of the identified elements and shortlist candidates, we identified elements where presence of mutations correlated significantly with expression levels (e.g., TERT and CDH10) and survival (e.g., CDH9 and CDH10) in an independent set of 505 TCGA whole-genome samples. In a larger pan-cancer set of 4128 TCGA exomes with expression profiling, we identified mutational correlation with expression for additional elements (e.g., near GATA3, CDC6, ZNF217, and CTCF transcription factor binding sites). Survival analysis further pointed to MIR122, a known marker of poor prognosis in liver cancer. In conclusion, the screen for significant mutation patterns coupled with correlative mutational analysis identified new individual driver candidates and suggest that some non-coding mutations recurrently affect expression and play a role in cancer development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iranzo, Jaime</author><author>Martincorena, Iñigo</author><author>Koonin, Eugene V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cancer-mutation network and the number and specificity of driver mutations.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>E6010-E6019</pages><volume>115</volume><issue>26</issue><keywords><keyword>bipartite networks</keyword><keyword>cancer types</keyword><keyword>community detection</keyword><keyword>driver mutations</keyword><keyword>passenger mutations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29895694</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1803155115</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - Iranzo, Martincorena, Koonin - Unknown - Cancer-mutation network and the number and specificity of driver mutations.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1803155115</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29895694</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6042135</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancer genomics has produced extensive information on cancer-associated genes, but the number and specificity of cancer-driver mutations remains a matter of debate. We constructed a bipartite network in which 7,665 tumors from 30 cancer types are connected via shared mutations in 198 previously identified cancer genes. We show that about 27% of the tumors can be assigned to statistically supported modules, most of which encompass one or two cancer types. The rest of the tumors belong to a diffuse network component suggesting lower gene specificity of driver mutations. Linear regression of the mutational loads in cancer genes was used to estimate the number of drivers required for the onset of different cancers. The mean number of drivers in known cancer genes is approximately two, with a range of one to five. Cancers that are associated with modules had more drivers than those from the diffuse network component, suggesting that unidentified and/or interchangeable drivers exist in the latter.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spencer-Smith, Russell</author><author>O'Bryan, John P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Direct inhibition of RAS: Quest for the Holy Grail?</title><secondary-title>Seminars in cancer biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Seminars in cancer biology</full-title></periodical><pages>138-148</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>December 2017</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>High-throughput screening</keyword><keyword>RAS biologics</keyword><keyword>RAS inhibitor</keyword><keyword>RAS monobody</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><accession-num>29248537</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.semcancer.2017.12.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://1-s2.0-S1044579X17302213-main.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcancer.2017.12.005</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29248537</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6258355</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>RAS GTPases (H-, K-, and N-RAS) are the most frequently mutated oncoprotein family in human cancer. However, the relatively smooth surface architecture of RAS and its picomolar affinity for nucleotide have given rise to the assumption that RAS is an &quot;undruggable&quot; target. Recent advancements in drug screening, molecular modeling, and a greater understanding of RAS function have led to a resurgence in efforts to pharmacologically target this challenging foe.

Fundamental to network analysis is the concept that genes underlying the same phenotype tend to interact; this principle can be used to combine and to amplify signals from individual genes. Recently, numerous bioinformatic techniques have been proposed for genetic analysis using networks, based on random walks, information diffusion and electrical resistance. These approaches have been applied successfully to identify disease genes, genetic modules and drug targets. In fact, all these approaches are variations of a unifying mathematical machinery - network propagation - suggesting that it is a powerful data transformation method of broad utility in genetic research.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barretina, Jordi</author><author>Caponigro, Giordano</author><author>Stransky, Nicolas</author><author>Venkatesan, Kavitha</author><author>Margolin, Adam A</author><author>Kim, Sungjoon</author><author>Wilson, Christopher J</author><author>Lehár, Joseph</author><author>Kryukov, Gregory V</author><author>Sonkin, Dmitriy</author><author>Reddy, Anupama</author><author>Liu, Manway</author><author>Murray, Lauren</author><author>Berger, Michael F</author><author>Monahan, John E</author><author>Morais, Paula</author><author>Meltzer, Jodi</author><author>Korejwa, Adam</author><author>Jané-Valbuena, Judit</author><author>Mapa, Felipa A</author><author>Thibault, Joseph</author><author>Bric-Furlong, Eva</author><author>Raman, Pichai</author><author>Shipway, Aaron</author><author>Engels, Ingo H</author><author>Cheng, Jill</author><author>Yu, Guoying K</author><author>Yu, Jianjun</author><author>Aspesi, Peter</author><author>de Silva, Melanie</author><author>Jagtap, Kalpana</author><author>Jones, Michael D</author><author>Wang, Li</author><author>Hatton, Charles</author><author>Palescandolo, Emanuele</author><author>Gupta, Supriya</author><author>Mahan, Scott</author><author>Sougnez, Carrie</author><author>Onofrio, Robert C</author><author>Liefeld, Ted</author><author>MacConaill, Laura</author><author>Winckler, Wendy</author><author>Reich, Michael</author><author>Li, Nanxin</author><author>Mesirov, Jill P</author><author>Gabriel, Stacey B</author><author>Getz, Gad</author><author>Ardlie, Kristin</author><author>Chan, Vivien</author><author>Myer, Vic E</author><author>Weber, Barbara L</author><author>Porter, Jeff</author><author>Warmuth, Markus</author><author>Finan, Peter</author><author>Harris, Jennifer L</author><author>Meyerson, Matthew</author><author>Golub, Todd R</author><author>Morrissey, Michael P</author><author>Sellers, William R</author><author>Schlegel, Robert</author><author>Garraway, Levi A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>603-7</pages><volume>483</volume><issue>7391</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22460905</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature11003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Barretina et al. - Nature - The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.broadinstitute.org/ccle</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22460905</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3320027</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vasaikar, Suhas</author><author>Huang, Chen</author><author>Wang, Xiaojing</author><author>Petyuk, Vladislav A</author><author>Savage, Sara R</author><author>Wen, Bo</author><author>Dou, Yongchao</author><author>Zhang, Yun</author><author>Shi, Zhiao</author><author>Arshad, Osama A</author><author>Gritsenko, Marina A</author><author>Zimmerman, Lisa J</author><author>McDermott, Jason E.</author><author>Clauss, Therese R</author><author>Moore, Ronald J</author><author>Zhao, Rui</author><author>Monroe, Matthew E</author><author>Wang, Yi-Ting</author><author>Chambers, Matthew C</author><author>Slebos, Robbert J C</author><author>Lau, Ken S</author><author>Mo, Qianxing</author><author>Ding, Li</author><author>Ellis, Matthew</author><author>Thiagarajan, Mathangi</author><author>Kinsinger, Christopher R</author><author>Rodriguez, Henry</author><author>Smith, Richard D</author><author>Rodland, Karin D</author><author>Liebler, Daniel C</author><author>Liu, Tao</author><author>Zhang, Bing</author><author>Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Proteogenomic Analysis of Human Colon Cancer Reveals New Therapeutic Opportunities.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><volume>177</volume><keywords><keyword>RB1</keyword><keyword>SOX9</keyword><keyword>biomarkers</keyword><keyword>colon cancer</keyword><keyword>drug targets</keyword><keyword>glycolysis</keyword><keyword>immune evasion</keyword><keyword>proteogenomics</keyword><keyword>proteomics</keyword><keyword>tumor antigen</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31031003</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2019.03.030</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Vasaikar et al. - Cell - Proteogenomic Analysis of Human Colon Cancer Reveals New Therapeutic Opportunities In Brief A systematic.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.03.030</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867419302922</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31031003</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We performed the first proteogenomic study on a prospectively collected colon cancer cohort. Comparative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of paired tumor and normal adjacent tissues produced a catalog of colon cancer-associated proteins and phosphosites, including known and putative new biomarkers, drug targets, and cancer/testis antigens. Proteogenomic integration not only prioritized genomically inferred targets, such as copy-number drivers and mutation-derived neoantigens, but also yielded novel findings. Phosphoproteomics data associated Rb phosphorylation with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in colon cancer, which explains why this classical tumor suppressor is amplified in colon tumors and suggests a rationale for targeting Rb phosphorylation in colon cancer. Proteomics identified an association between decreased CD8 T cell infiltration and increased glycolysis in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, suggesting glycolysis as a potential target to overcome the resistance of MSI-H tumors to immune checkpoint blockade.

For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manly, B F J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Randomization, Bootstrap and Monte Carlo Methods in Biology</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>CRC Press</publisher><isbn>9781482296419</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>https://books.google.com/books?id=T01ZDwAAQBAJ</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Las Rivas, Javier</author><author>Fontanillo, Celia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein-protein interactions essentials: key concepts to building and analyzing interactome networks.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1000807</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20589078</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000807</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - De, Rivas, Fontanillo - Unknown - Education Protein-Protein Interactions Essentials Key Concepts to Building and Analyzing Int.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://bond.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20589078</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2891586</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vella, Danila</author><author>Zoppis, Italo</author><author>Mauri, Giancarlo</author><author>Mauri, Pierluigi</author><author>Di Silvestre, Dario</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From protein-protein interactions to protein co-expression networks: a new perspective to evaluate large-scale proteomic data.</title><secondary-title>EURASIP journal on bioinformatics &amp; systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>EURASIP journal on bioinformatics &amp; systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>6</pages><volume>2017</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>-Omics data</keyword><keyword>Co-expression network</keyword><keyword>PPI network</keyword><keyword>Pearson’s correlation</keyword><keyword>Systems biology</keyword><keyword>Topological analysis</keyword><keyword>WGCNA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28477207</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13637-017-0059-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Vella et al. - EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology - From protein-protein interactions to protein co-expression.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bsb-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13637-017-0059-z</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28477207</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5359264</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The reductionist approach of dissecting biological systems into their constituents has been successful in the first stage of the molecular biology to elucidate the chemical basis of several biological processes. This knowledge helped biologists to understand the complexity of the biological systems evidencing that most biological functions do not arise from individual molecules; thus, realizing that the emergent properties of the biological systems cannot be explained or be predicted by investigating individual molecules without taking into consideration their relations. Thanks to the improvement of the current -omics technologies and the increasing understanding of the molecular relationships, even more studies are evaluating the biological systems through approaches based on graph theory. Genomic and proteomic data are often combined with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks whose structure is routinely analyzed by algorithms and tools to characterize hubs/bottlenecks and topological, functional, and disease modules. On the other hand, co-expression networks represent a complementary procedure that give the opportunity to evaluate at system level including organisms that lack information on PPIs. Based on these premises, we introduce the reader to the PPI and to the co-expression networks, including aspects of reconstruction and analysis. In particular, the new idea to evaluate large-scale proteomic data by means of co-expression networks will be discussed presenting some examples of application. Their use to infer biological knowledge will be shown, and a special attention will be devoted to the topological and module analysis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vella, Danila</author><author>Marini, Simone</author><author>Vitali, Francesca</author><author>Di Silvestre, Dario</author><author>Mauri, Giancarlo</author><author>Bellazzi, Riccardo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MTGO: PPI Network Analysis Via Topological and Functional Module Identification.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title></periodical><pages>5499</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29615773</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-018-23672-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Vella et al. - Scientific REPORTs - MTGO PPI Network Analysis Via Topological and Functional Module Identification OPEN.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://gitlab.com/d1vella/MTGO.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29615773</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5882952</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are viable tools to understand cell functions, disease machinery, and drug design/repositioning. Interpreting a PPI, however, it is a particularly challenging task because of network complexity. Several algorithms have been proposed for an automatic PPI interpretation, at first by solely considering the network topology, and later by integrating Gene Ontology (GO) terms as node similarity attributes. Here we present MTGO - Module detection via Topological information and GO knowledge, a novel functional module identification approach. MTGO let emerge the bimolecular machinery underpinning PPI networks by leveraging on both biological knowledge and topological properties. In particular, it directly exploits GO terms during the module assembling process, and labels each module with its best fit GO term, easing its functional interpretation. MTGO shows largely better results than other state of the art algorithms (including recent GO-based ones) when searching for small or sparse functional modules, while providing comparable or better results all other cases. MTGO correctly identifies molecular complexes and literature-consistent processes in an experimentally derived PPI network of Myocardial infarction.

Additionally, small sub-networks within PPI networks that demonstrate synergistic differential expression with respect to tumorigenic phenotypes were recently shown to be more accurate classifiers of disease progression when compared to single targets identified by traditional approaches. However, many of these studies rely exclusively on mRNA expression data, a useful but limited measure of cellular activity. Proteomic profiling experiments provide information at the post-translational level, yet they generally screen only a limited fraction of the proteome. Here, we demonstrate that integration of these complementary data sources with a &quot;proteomics-first&quot; approach can enhance the discovery of candidate sub-networks in cancer that are well-suited for mechanistic validation in disease. We propose that small changes in the mRNA expression of multiple genes in the neighborhood of a protein-hub can be synergistically associated with significant changes in the activity of that protein and its network neighbors. Further, we hypothesize that proteomic targets with significant fold change between phenotype and control may be used to &quot;seed&quot; a search for small PPI sub-networks that are functionally associated with these targets. To test this hypothesis, we select proteomic targets having significant expression changes in human colorectal cancer (CRC) from two independent 2-D gel-based screens. Then, we use random walk based models of network crosstalk and develop novel reference models to identify sub-networks that are statistically significant in terms of their functional association with these proteomic targets. Subsequently, using an information-theoretic measure, we evaluate synergistic changes in the activity of identified sub-networks based on genome-wide screens of mRNA expression in CRC. Cross-classification experiments to predict disease class show excellent performance using only a few sub-networks, underwriting the strength of the proposed approach in discovering relevant and reproducible sub-networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Poulin, Emily J</author><author>Bera, Asim K</author><author>Lu, Jia</author><author>Lin, Yi-Jang</author><author>Strasser, Samantha Dale</author><author>Paulo, Joao A</author><author>Huang, Tannie Q</author><author>Morales, Carolina</author><author>Yan, Wei</author><author>Cook, Joshua</author><author>Nowak, Jonathan A</author><author>Brubaker, Douglas K</author><author>Joughin, Brian A</author><author>Johnson, Christian W</author><author>DeStefanis, Rebecca A</author><author>Ghazi, Phaedra C</author><author>Gondi, Sudershan</author><author>Wales, Thomas E</author><author>Iacob, Roxana E</author><author>Bogdanova, Lana</author><author>Gierut, Jessica J</author><author>Li, Yina</author><author>Engen, John R</author><author>Perez-Mancera, Pedro A</author><author>Braun, Benjamin S</author><author>Gygi, Steven P</author><author>Lauffenburger, Douglas A</author><author>Westover, Kenneth D</author><author>Haigis, Kevin M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tissue-specific oncogenic activity of K-RasA146T.</title><secondary-title>Cancer discovery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer discovery</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30952657</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-1220</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Poulin et al. - Cancer discovery - Tissue-specific oncogenic activity of K-RasA146T.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/candisc/early/2019/04/05/2159-8290.CD-18-1220.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30952657</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut;proj:tissuespec</label><abstract>KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene.

Biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that K-RasA146T exhibits a marked extension of switch 1 away from the protein body and nucleotide binding site, which activates K-Ras by promoting a high rate of intrinsic and GEF-induced nucleotide exchange. Using mice genetically engineered to express either allele, we found that K-RasG12D and K-RasA146T exhibit distinct tissue-specific effects on homeostasis that mirror mutational frequencies in human cancers. These tissue-specific phenotypes result from allele-specific signaling properties, demonstrating that context-dependent variations in signaling downstream of different K-Ras mutants drive the KRAS mutational pattern seen in cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Du, Juanjiangmeng</author><author>Sudarsanam, Monica</author><author>Pérez-Palma, Eduardo</author><author>Ganna, Andrea</author><author>Francioli, Laurent</author><author>Iqbal, Sumaiya</author><author>Niestroj, Lisa-Marie</author><author>Leu, Costin</author><author>Weisburd, Ben</author><author>Poterba, Tim</author><author>Nürnberg, Peter</author><author>Daly, Mark J</author><author>Palotie, Aarno</author><author>May, Patrick</author><author>Lal, Dennis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variant Score Ranker-a web application for intuitive missense variant prioritization</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btz252/5480132</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - Du et al. - Unknown - Variant Score Ranker-a web application for intuitive missense variant prioritization.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://watermark.silverchair.com/btz252.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAokwggKFBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJ2MIICcgIBADCCAmsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMjMommhK9mGH7gVMqAgEQgIICPGr8vcIZXv4Lv99Oiv9FH8HoXnLKoAlKmfy1f736Jpv7yNm6</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The correct classification of missense variants as benign or pathogenic remains challenging. Pathogenic variants are expected to have higher deleterious prediction scores than benign variants in the same gene. However, most of the existing variant annotation tools do not reference the score range of benign population variants on gene level. Here, we present a web-application, Variant Score Ranker, which enables users to rapidly annotate variants and perform gene-specific variant score ranking on the population level. We also provide an intuitive example of how gene-and population-calibrated variant ranking scores can improve epilepsy variant prioritization.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo M</author><author>Wiberg, Holli K</author><author>Matzke, Melissa M</author><author>Brown, Joseph N</author><author>Wang, Jing</author><author>McDermott, Jason E</author><author>Smith, Richard D</author><author>Rodland, Karin D</author><author>Metz, Thomas O</author><author>Pounds, Joel G</author><author>Waters, Katrina M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Review, evaluation, and discussion of the challenges of missing value imputation for mass spectrometry-based label-free global proteomics.</title><secondary-title>Journal of proteome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of proteome research</full-title></periodical><pages>1993-2001</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Imputation</keyword><keyword>accuracy</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>label free</keyword><keyword>mean-square error</keyword><keyword>peak intensity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25855118</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/pr501138h</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Webb-Robertson et al. - Journal of proteome research - Review, evaluation, and discussion of the challenges of missing value impu.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ii.uib.no/~trondb/imputation/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25855118</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4776766</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this review, we apply selected imputation strategies to label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomics datasets to evaluate the accuracy with respect to metrics of variance and classification. We evaluate several commonly used imputation approaches for individual merits and discuss the caveats of each approach with respect to the example LC-MS proteomics data. In general, local similarity-based approaches, such as the regularized expectation maximization and least-squares adaptive algorithms, yield the best overall performances with respect to metrics of accuracy and robustness. However, no single algorithm consistently outperforms the remaining approaches, and in some cases, performing classification without imputation sometimes yielded the most accurate classification. Thus, because of the complex mechanisms of missing data in proteomics, which also vary from peptide to protein, no individual method is a single solution for imputation. On the basis of the observations in this review, the goal for imputation in the field of computational proteomics should be to develop new approaches that work generically for this data type and new strategies to guide users in the selection of the best imputation for their dataset and analysis objectives.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gunawardena, Harsha P</author><author>O'Brien, Jonathon</author><author>Wrobel, John A</author><author>Xie, Ling</author><author>Davies, Sherri R</author><author>Li, Shunqiang</author><author>Ellis, Matthew J</author><author>Qaqish, Bahjat F</author><author>Chen, Xian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>QuantFusion: Novel Unified Methodology for Enhanced Coverage and Precision in Quantifying Global Proteomic Changes in Whole Tissues.</title><secondary-title>Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics : MCP</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics : MCP</full-title></periodical><pages>740-51</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26598639</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/mcp.O115.049791</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Gunawardena et al. - Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics MCP - QuantFusion Novel Unified Methodology for Enhanced Coverage and Preci.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.mcponline.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26598639</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4739686</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Single quantitative platforms such as label-based or label-free quantitation (LFQ) present compromises in accuracy, precision, protein sequence coverage, and speed of quantifiable proteomic measurements. To maximize the quantitative precision and the number of quantifiable proteins or the quantifiable coverage of tissue proteomes, we have developed a unified approach, termed QuantFusion, that combines the quantitative ratios of all peptides measured by both LFQ and label-based methodologies. Here, we demonstrate the use of QuantFusion in determining the proteins differentially expressed in a pair of patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) representing two major breast cancer (BC) subtypes, basal and luminal. Label-based in-spectra quantitative peptides derived from amino acid-coded tagging (AACT, also known as SILAC) of a non-malignant mammary cell line were uniformly added to each xenograft with a constant predefined ratio, from which Ratio-of-Ratio estimates were obtained for the label-free peptides paired with AACT peptides in each PDX tumor. A mixed model statistical analysis was used to determine global differential protein expression by combining complementary quantifiable peptide ratios measured by LFQ and Ratio-of-Ratios, respectively. With minimum number of replicates required for obtaining the statistically significant ratios, QuantFusion uses the distinct mechanisms to &quot;rescue&quot; the missing data inherent to both LFQ and label-based quantitation. Combined quantifiable peptide data from both quantitative schemes increased the overall number of peptide level measurements and protein level estimates. In our analysis of the PDX tumor proteomes, QuantFusion increased the number of distinct peptide ratios by 65%, representing differentially expressed proteins between the BC subtypes. This quantifiable coverage improvement, in turn, not only increased the number of measurable protein fold-changes by 8% but also increased the average precision of quantitative estimates by 181% so that some BC subtypically expressed proteins were rescued by QuantFusion. Thus, incorporating data from multiple quantitative approaches while accounting for measurement variability at both the peptide and global protein levels make QuantFusion unique for obtaining increased coverage and quantitative precision for tissue proteomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taylor, Sandra L</author><author>Ruhaak, L Renee</author><author>Kelly, Karen</author><author>Weiss, Robert H</author><author>Kim, Kyoungmi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of imputation on correlation: implications for analysis of mass spectrometry data from multiple biological matrices.</title><secondary-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>312-320</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>imputation</keyword><keyword>mass spectrometry</keyword><keyword>metabolomics</keyword><keyword>missing data</keyword><keyword>multivariate analysis</keyword><keyword>within-subject correlation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>26896791</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bib/bbw010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Taylor et al. - Briefings in bioinformatics - Effects of imputation on correlation implications for analysis of mass spectrometry.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-abstract/18/2/312/2562741</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26896791</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5862252</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>With expanded access to, and decreased costs of, mass spectrometry, investigators are collecting and analyzing multiple biological matrices from the same subject such as serum, plasma, tissue and urine to enhance biomarker discoveries, understanding of disease processes and identification of therapeutic targets. Commonly, each biological matrix is analyzed separately, but multivariate methods such as MANOVAs that combine information from multiple biological matrices are potentially more powerful. However, mass spectrometric data typically contain large amounts of missing values, and imputation is often used to create complete data sets for analysis. The effects of imputation on multiple biological matrix analyses have not been studied. We investigated the effects of seven imputation methods (half minimum substitution, mean substitution, k-nearest neighbors, local least squares regression, Bayesian principal components analysis, singular value decomposition and random forest), on the within-subject correlation of compounds between biological matrices and its consequences on MANOVA results. Through analysis of three real omics data sets and simulation studies, we found the amount of missing data and imputation method to substantially change the between-matrix correlation structure. The magnitude of the correlations was generally reduced in imputed data sets, and this effect increased with the amount of missing data. Significant results from MANOVA testing also were substantially affected. In particular, the number of false positives increased with the level of missing data for all imputation methods. No one imputation method was universally the best, but the simple substitution methods (Half Minimum and Mean) consistently performed poorly.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>The, Matthew</author><author>Käll, Lukas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrated Identification and Quantification Error Probabilities for Shotgun Proteomics.</title><secondary-title>Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics : MCP</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics : MCP</full-title></periodical><pages>561-570</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Bioinformatics software</keyword><keyword>Biostatistics</keyword><keyword>Bladder cancer</keyword><keyword>Label-free quantification</keyword><keyword>Quantification</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30482846</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/mcp.RA118.001018</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - The, Käll - Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics MCP - Integrated Identification and Quantification Error Probabilities for Shotgun.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.RA118.001018</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30482846</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6398204</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Protein quantification by label-free shotgun proteomics experiments is plagued by a multitude of error sources. Typical pipelines for identifying differential proteins use intermediate filters to control the error rate. However, they often ignore certain error sources and, moreover, regard filtered lists as completely correct in subsequent steps. These two indiscretions can easily lead to a loss of control of the false discovery rate (FDR). We propose a probabilistic graphical model, Triqler, that propagates error information through all steps, employing distributions in favor of point estimates, most notably for missing value imputation. The model outputs posterior probabilities for fold changes between treatment groups, highlighting uncertainty rather than hiding it. We analyzed 3 engineered data sets and achieved FDR control and high sensitivity, even for truly absent proteins. In a bladder cancer clinical data set we discovered 35 proteins at 5% FDR, whereas the original study discovered 1 and MaxQuant/Perseus 4 proteins at this threshold. Compellingly, these 35 proteins showed enrichment for functional annotation terms, whereas the top ranked proteins reported by MaxQuant/Perseus showed no enrichment. The model executes in minutes and is freely available at https://pypi.org/project/triqler/.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karpievitch, Yuliya</author><author>Stanley, Jeff</author><author>Taverner, Thomas</author><author>Huang, Jianhua</author><author>Adkins, Joshua N</author><author>Ansong, Charles</author><author>Heffron, Fred</author><author>Metz, Thomas O</author><author>Qian, Wei-Jun</author><author>Yoon, Hyunjin</author><author>Smith, Richard D</author><author>Dabney, Alan R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A statistical framework for protein quantitation in bottom-up MS-based proteomics.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>2028-34</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19535538</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btp362</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Karpievitch et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - A statistical framework for protein quantitation in bottom-up MS-based pr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://omics.pnl.gov/software/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19535538</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2723007</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics requires protein-level estimates and associated confidence measures. Challenges include the presence of low quality or incorrectly identified peptides and informative missingness. Furthermore, models are required for rolling peptide-level information up to the protein level.

Detection of CpG methylation in human DNA obtained from blood or stool has been proposed as a promising approach to a noninvasive early diagnosis of CRC. Thousands of abnormally methylated CpG positions in CRC genomes are often located in non-coding parts of genes. Novel bioinformatic methods are thus urgently needed for multi-omics data analysis to reveal causative biomarkers with a potential driver role in early stages of cancer. METHODS We have developed a method for finding potential causal relationships between epigenetic changes (DNA methylations) in gene regulatory regions that affect transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and gene expression changes. This method also considers the topology of the involved signal transduction pathways and searches for positive feedback loops that may cause the carcinogenic aberrations in gene expression. We call this method &quot;Walking pathways&quot;, since it searches for potential rewiring mechanisms in cancer pathways due to dynamic changes in the DNA methylation status of important gene regulatory regions (&quot;epigenomic walking&quot;). RESULTS In this paper, we analysed an extensive collection of full genome gene-expression data (RNA-seq) and DNA methylation data of genomic CpG islands (using Illumina methylation arrays) generated from a sample of tumor and normal gut epithelial tissues of 300 patients with colorectal cancer (at different stages of the disease) (data generated in the EU-supported SysCol project). Identification of potential epigenetic biomarkers of DNA methylation was performed using the fully automatic multi-omics analysis web service &quot;My Genome Enhancer&quot; (MGE) (my-genome-enhancer.com). MGE uses the database on gene regulation TRANSFAC®, the signal transduction pathways database TRANSPATH®, and software that employs AI (artificial intelligence) methods for the analysis of cancer-specific enhancers. CONCLUSIONS The identified biomarkers underwent experimental testing on an independent set of blood samples from patients with colorectal cancer. As a result, using advanced methods of statistics and machine learning, a minimum set of 6 biomarkers was selected, which together achieve the best cancer detection potential. The markers include hypermethylated positions in regulatory regions of the following genes: CALCA, ENO1, MYC, PDX1, TCF7, ZNF43.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krüger, Sandra</author><author>Piro, Rosario M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>decompTumor2Sig: identification of mutational signatures active in individual tumors.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>152</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>Suppl 4</issue><keywords><keyword>Decomposition of tumor genomes</keyword><keyword>Mutational processes</keyword><keyword>Mutational signatures</keyword><keyword>Signature refitting</keyword><keyword>Somatic mutations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30999866</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-019-2688-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Krüger, Piro - BMC bioinformatics - decompTumor2Sig identification of mutational signatures active in individual tumors.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2688-6</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999866</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6472187</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND The somatic mutations found in a tumor have in most cases been caused by multiple mutational processes such as those related to extrinsic carcinogens like cigarette smoke, and those related to intrinsic processes like age-related spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine. The effect of such mutational processes can be modeled by mutational signatures, of which two different conceptualizations exist: the model introduced by Alexandrov et al., Nature 500:415-421, 2013, and the model introduced by Shiraishi et al., PLoS Genetics 11(12):e1005657, 2015. The initial identification and definition of mutational signatures requires large sets of tumor samples. RESULTS Here, we present decompTumor2Sig, an easy to use R package that can decompose an individual tumor genome into a given set of Alexandrov-type or Shiraishi-type signatures, thus quantifying the contribution of the corresponding mutational processes to the somatic mutations identified in the tumor. Until now, such tools were available only for Alexandrov signatures. We demonstrate the correctness and usefulness of our approach with three test cases, using somatic mutations from 21 breast cancer genomes, from 435 tumor genomes of ten different tumor entities, and from simulated tumor genomes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The decompTumor2Sig package is freely available and has been accepted for inclusion in Bioconductor.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rahiminejad, Sara</author><author>Maurya, Mano R</author><author>Subramaniam, Shankar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Topological and functional comparison of community detection algorithms in biological networks.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>212</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological function</keyword><keyword>Biological networks</keyword><keyword>Community detection</keyword><keyword>Modularity</keyword><keyword>Pathways</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>31029085</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-019-2746-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Rahiminejad, Maurya, Subramaniam - BMC Bioinformatics - Topological and functional comparison of community detection algorithms i.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2746-0</url><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2746-0</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029085</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Community detection algorithms are fundamental tools to uncover important features in networks. There are several studies focused on social networks but only a few deal with biological networks. Directly or indirectly, most of the methods maximize modularity, a measure of the density of links within communities as compared to links between communities. RESULTS Here we analyze six different community detection algorithms, namely, Combo, Conclude, Fast Greedy, Leading Eigen, Louvain and Spinglass, on two important biological networks to find their communities and evaluate the results in terms of topological and functional features through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis. At a high level, the main assessment criteria are 1) appropriate community size (neither too small nor too large), 2) representation within the community of only one or two broad biological functions, 3) most genes from the network belonging to a pathway should also belong to only one or two communities, and 4) performance speed. The first network in this study is a network of Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Yeast) with 6532 nodes and 229,696 edges and the second is a network of PPI in Homo sapiens (Human) with 20,644 nodes and 241,008 edges. All six methods perform well, i.e., find reasonably sized and biologically interpretable communities, for the Yeast PPI network but the Conclude method does not find reasonably sized communities for the Human PPI network. Louvain method maximizes modularity by using an agglomerative approach, and is the fastest method for community detection. For the Yeast PPI network, the results of Spinglass method are most similar to the results of Louvain method with regard to the size of communities and core pathways they identify, whereas for the Human PPI network, Combo and Spinglass methods yield the most similar results, with Louvain being the next closest. CONCLUSIONS For Yeast and Human PPI networks, Louvain method is likely the best method to find communities in terms of detecting known core pathways in a reasonable time.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shihab, Hashem A.</author><author>Gough, Julian</author><author>Cooper, David N.</author><author>Stenson, Peter D.</author><author>Barker, Gary L A</author><author>Edwards, Keith J.</author><author>Day, Ian N M</author><author>Gaunt, Tom R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting the functional, molecular, and phenotypic consequences of amino acid substitutions using hidden Markov models.</title><secondary-title>Human mutation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human mutation</full-title></periodical><pages>57-65</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>FATHMM</keyword><keyword>Hidden Markov models</keyword><keyword>SNP</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23033316</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/humu.22225</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Shihab et al. - Human mutation - Predicting the functional, molecular, and phenotypic consequences of amino acid substitutions us.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23033316</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3558800</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The rate at which nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are being identified in the human genome is increasing dramatically owing to advances in whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing technologies. Automated methods capable of accurately and reliably distinguishing between pathogenic and functionally neutral nsSNPs are therefore assuming ever-increasing importance. Here, we describe the Functional Analysis Through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) software and server: a species-independent method with optional species-specific weightings for the prediction of the functional effects of protein missense variants. Using a model weighted for human mutations, we obtained performance accuracies that outperformed traditional prediction methods (i.e., SIFT, PolyPhen, and PANTHER) on two separate benchmarks. Furthermore, in one benchmark, we achieve performance accuracies that outperform current state-of-the-art prediction methods (i.e., SNPs&amp;GO and MutPred). We demonstrate that FATHMM can be efficiently applied to high-throughput/large-scale human and nonhuman genome sequencing projects with the added benefit of phenotypic outcome associations. To illustrate this, we evaluated nsSNPs in wheat (Triticum spp.) to identify some of the important genetic variants responsible for the phenotypic differences introduced by intense selection during domestication. A Web-based implementation of FATHMM, including a high-throughput batch facility and a downloadable standalone package, is available at http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carter, Hannah</author><author>Douville, Christopher</author><author>Stenson, Peter D</author><author>Cooper, David N</author><author>Karchin, Rachel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying Mendelian disease genes with the variant effect scoring tool.</title><secondary-title>BMC genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC genomics</full-title></periodical><pages>S3</pages><volume>14 Suppl 3</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23819870</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2164-14-S3-S3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Carter et al. - BMC genomics - Identifying Mendelian disease genes with the variant effect scoring tool.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cravat.us</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23819870</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3665549</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Whole exome sequencing studies identify hundreds to thousands of rare protein coding variants of ambiguous significance for human health. Computational tools are needed to accelerate the identification of specific variants and genes that contribute to human disease. RESULTS We have developed the Variant Effect Scoring Tool (VEST), a supervised machine learning-based classifier, to prioritize rare missense variants with likely involvement in human disease. The VEST classifier training set comprised ~ 45,000 disease mutations from the latest Human Gene Mutation Database release and another ~45,000 high frequency (allele frequency &gt;1%) putatively neutral missense variants from the Exome Sequencing Project. VEST outperforms some of the most popular methods for prioritizing missense variants in carefully designed holdout benchmarking experiments (VEST ROC AUC = 0.91, PolyPhen2 ROC AUC = 0.86, SIFT4.0 ROC AUC = 0.84). VEST estimates variant score p-values against a null distribution of VEST scores for neutral variants not included in the VEST training set. These p-values can be aggregated at the gene level across multiple disease exomes to rank genes for probable disease involvement. We tested the ability of an aggregate VEST gene score to identify candidate Mendelian disease genes, based on whole-exome sequencing of a small number of disease cases. We used whole-exome data for two Mendelian disorders for which the causal gene is known. Considering only genes that contained variants in all cases, the VEST gene score ranked dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) number 2 of 2253 genes in four cases of Miller syndrome, and myosin-3 (MYH3) number 2 of 2313 genes in three cases of Freeman Sheldon syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate the potential power gain of aggregating bioinformatics variant scores into gene-level scores and the general utility of bioinformatics in assisting the search for disease genes in large-scale exome sequencing studies. VEST is available as a stand-alone software package at http://wiki.chasmsoftware.org and is hosted by the CRAVAT web server at http://www.cravat.us.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reva, Boris</author><author>Antipin, Yevgeniy</author><author>Sander, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting the functional impact of protein mutations: application to cancer genomics.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>e118</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21727090</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkr407</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Reva, Antipin, Sander - Nucleic acids research - Predicting the functional impact of protein mutations application to cancer geno.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/39/17/e118/2411278</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21727090</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3177186</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As large-scale re-sequencing of genomes reveals many protein mutations, especially in human cancer tissues, prediction of their likely functional impact becomes important practical goal. Here, we introduce a new functional impact score (FIS) for amino acid residue changes using evolutionary conservation patterns. The information in these patterns is derived from aligned families and sub-families of sequence homologs within and between species using combinatorial entropy formalism. The score performs well on a large set of human protein mutations in separating disease-associated variants (∼19 200), assumed to be strongly functional, from common polymorphisms (∼35 600), assumed to be weakly functional (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ∼0.86). In cancer, using recurrence, multiplicity and annotation for ∼10 000 mutations in the COSMIC database, the method does well in assigning higher scores to more likely functional mutations ('drivers'). To guide experimental prioritization, we report a list of about 1000 top human cancer genes frequently mutated in one or more cancer types ranked by likely functional impact; and, an additional 1000 candidate cancer genes with rare but likely functional mutations. In addition, we estimate that at least 5% of cancer-relevant mutations involve switch of function, rather than simply loss or gain of function.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Jianjiong</author><author>Chang, Matthew T</author><author>Johnsen, Hannah C</author><author>Gao, Sizhi Paul</author><author>Sylvester, Brooke E</author><author>Sumer, Selcuk Onur</author><author>Zhang, Hongxin</author><author>Solit, David B</author><author>Taylor, Barry S</author><author>Schultz, Nikolaus</author><author>Sander, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>3D clusters of somatic mutations in cancer reveal numerous rare mutations as functional targets.</title><secondary-title>Genome medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>4</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer genomics</keyword><keyword>Driver mutations</keyword><keyword>Precision medicine</keyword><keyword>Protein structures</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28115009</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13073-016-0393-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Gao et al. - Genome medicine - 3D clusters of somatic mutations in cancer reveal numerous rare mutations as functional targets.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.uniprot.org/help/cano</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28115009</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5260099</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Many mutations in cancer are of unknown functional significance. Standard methods use statistically significant recurrence of mutations in tumor samples as an indicator of functional impact. We extend such analyses into the long tail of rare mutations by considering recurrence of mutations in clusters of spatially close residues in protein structures.

However, their three-dimensional spatial relationships in the encoded protein have yet to be systematically explored. We developed a computational tool, HotSpot3D, to identify such spatial hotspots (clusters) and to interpret the potential function of variants within them. We applied HotSpot3D to &gt;4,400 TCGA tumors across 19 cancer types, discovering &gt;6,000 intra- and intermolecular clusters, some of which showed tumor and/or tissue specificity. In addition, we identified 369 rare mutations in genes including TP53, PTEN, VHL, EGFR, and FBXW7 and 99 medium-recurrence mutations in genes such as RUNX1, MTOR, CA3, PI3, and PTPN11, all mapping within clusters having potential functional implications. As a proof of concept, we validated our predictions in EGFR using high-throughput phosphorylation data and cell-line-based experimental evaluation. Finally, mutation-drug cluster and network analysis predicted over 800 promising candidates for druggable mutations, raising new possibilities for designing personalized treatments for patients carrying specific mutations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tokheim, Collin</author><author>Bhattacharya, Rohit</author><author>Niknafs, Noushin</author><author>Gygax, Derek M</author><author>Kim, Rick</author><author>Ryan, Michael</author><author>Masica, David L</author><author>Karchin, Rachel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exome-Scale Discovery of Hotspot Mutation Regions in Human Cancer Using 3D Protein Structure.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>3719-31</pages><volume>76</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27197156</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-3190</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Tokheim et al. - Cancer research - Exome-Scale Discovery of Hotspot Mutation Regions in Human Cancer Using 3D Protein Structure.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27197156</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4930736</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The impact of somatic missense mutation on cancer etiology and progression is often difficult to interpret. One common approach for assessing the contribution of missense mutations in carcinogenesis is to identify genes mutated with statistically nonrandom frequencies. Even given the large number of sequenced cancer samples currently available, this approach remains underpowered to detect drivers, particularly in less studied cancer types. Alternative statistical and bioinformatic approaches are needed. One approach to increase power is to focus on localized regions of increased missense mutation density or hotspot regions, rather than a whole gene or protein domain. Detecting missense mutation hotspot regions in three-dimensional (3D) protein structure may also be beneficial because linear sequence alone does not fully describe the biologically relevant organization of codons. Here, we present a novel and statistically rigorous algorithm for detecting missense mutation hotspot regions in 3D protein structures. We analyzed approximately 3 × 10(5) mutations from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified 216 tumor-type-specific hotspot regions. In addition to experimentally determined protein structures, we considered high-quality structural models, which increase genomic coverage from approximately 5,000 to more than 15,000 genes. We provide new evidence that 3D mutation analysis has unique advantages. It enables discovery of hotspot regions in many more genes than previously shown and increases sensitivity to hotspot regions in tumor suppressor genes (TSG). Although hotspot regions have long been known to exist in both TSGs and oncogenes, we provide the first report that they have different characteristic properties in the two types of driver genes. We show how cancer researchers can use our results to link 3D protein structure and the biologic functions of missense mutations in cancer, and to generate testable hypotheses about driver mechanisms. Our results are included in a new interactive website for visualizing protein structures with TCGA mutations and associated hotspot regions. Users can submit new sequence data, facilitating the visualization of mutations in a biologically relevant context.

To that end we use e-Driver, an algorithm to analyze the mutation distribution of specific protein functional regions. We identified 103 PPI interfaces enriched in somatic cancer mutations. 32 of these interfaces are found in proteins coded by known cancer driver genes. The remaining 71 interfaces are found in proteins that have not been previously identified as cancer drivers even that, in most cases, there is an extensive literature suggesting they play an important role in cancer.

We analyzed 800 cancer genomes of eight types to find single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that precisely target phosphorylation machinery, important in cancer development and drug targeting. Assuming that cancer-related biological systems involve unexpectedly frequent mutations, we used novel algorithms to identify genes with significant phosphorylation-associated SNVs (pSNVs), phospho-mutated pathways, kinase networks, drug targets, and clinically correlated signaling modules. We highlight increased survival of patients with TP53 pSNVs, hierarchically organized cancer kinase modules, a novel pSNV in EGFR, and an immune-related network of pSNVs that correlates with prolonged survival in ovarian cancer. Our findings include multiple actionable cancer gene candidates (FLNB, GRM1, POU2F1), protein complexes (HCF1, ASF1), and kinases (PRKCZ).

This approach may be correct to describe effects of gene loss or changes in gene expression; however, mutations may have different effects, including their relevance to cancer, depending on which region of the gene they affect. Except for rare and well-known exceptions, there are not enough data for reliable statistics for individual positions, but an intermediate level of analysis, between an individual position and the entire gene, may give us better statistics than the former and better resolution than the latter approach. RESULTS We have developed e-Driver, a method that exploits the internal distribution of somatic missense mutations between the protein's functional regions (domains or intrinsically disordered regions) to find those that show a bias in their mutation rate as compared with other regions of the same protein, providing evidence of positive selection and suggesting that these proteins may be actual cancer drivers. We have applied e-Driver to a large cancer genome dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas and compared its performance with that of four other methods, showing that e-Driver identifies novel candidate cancer drivers and, because of its increased resolution, provides deeper insights into the potential mechanism of cancer driver genes identified by other methods.

We sought to determine the overall extent of this feature in cancer and the possibility to use this feature to identify drivers. RESULTS We have developed OncodriveCLUST, a method to identify genes with a significant bias towards mutation clustering within the protein sequence. This method constructs the background model by assessing coding-silent mutations, which are assumed not to be under positive selection and thus may reflect the baseline tendency of somatic mutations to be clustered. OncodriveCLUST analysis of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer retrieved a list of genes enriched by the Cancer Gene Census, prioritizing those with dominant phenotypes but also highlighting some recessive cancer genes, which showed wider but still delimited mutation clusters. Assessment of datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrated that OncodriveCLUST selected cancer genes that were nevertheless missed by methods based on frequency and functional impact criteria. This stressed the benefit of combining approaches based on complementary principles to identify driver mutations. We propose OncodriveCLUST as an effective tool for that purpose.

The method has high sensitivity and specificity when discriminating between known driver missense mutations and randomly generated missense mutations (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, &gt;0.91; area under Precision-Recall curve, &gt;0.79).

We applied the method to 607 missense mutations found in a recent glioblastoma multiforme sequencing study. Based on a model that assumed the glioblastoma multiforme mutations are a mixture of drivers and passengers, we estimate that 8% of these mutations are drivers, causally contributing to tumorigenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dees, Nathan D</author><author>Zhang, Qunyuan</author><author>Kandoth, Cyriac</author><author>Wendl, Michael C</author><author>Schierding, William</author><author>Koboldt, Daniel C</author><author>Mooney, Thomas B</author><author>Callaway, Matthew B</author><author>Dooling, David</author><author>Mardis, Elaine R</author><author>Wilson, Richard K</author><author>Ding, Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MuSiC: identifying mutational significance in cancer genomes.</title><secondary-title>Genome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome research</full-title></periodical><pages>1589-98</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22759861</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.134635.111</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Dees et al. - Genome research - MuSiC identifying mutational significance in cancer genomes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.134635.111.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22759861</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3409272</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Massively parallel sequencing technology and the associated rapidly decreasing sequencing costs have enabled systemic analyses of somatic mutations in large cohorts of cancer cases. Here we introduce a comprehensive mutational analysis pipeline that uses standardized sequence-based inputs along with multiple types of clinical data to establish correlations among mutation sites, affected genes and pathways, and to ultimately separate the commonly abundant passenger mutations from the truly significant events. In other words, we aim to determine the Mutational Significance in Cancer (MuSiC) for these large data sets. The integration of analytical operations in the MuSiC framework is widely applicable to a broad set of tumor types and offers the benefits of automation as well as standardization. Herein, we describe the computational structure and statistical underpinnings of the MuSiC pipeline and demonstrate its performance using 316 ovarian cancer samples from the TCGA ovarian cancer project. MuSiC correctly confirms many expected results, and identifies several potentially novel avenues for discovery.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Benvenuti, Silvia</author><author>Sartore-Bianchi, Andrea</author><author>Di Nicolantonio, Federica</author><author>Zanon, Carlo</author><author>Moroni, Mauro</author><author>Veronese, Silvio</author><author>Siena, Salvatore</author><author>Bardelli, Alberto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oncogenic activation of the RAS/RAF signaling pathway impairs the response of metastatic colorectal cancers to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapies.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>2643-8</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17363584</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4158</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Benvenuti et al. - Cancer research - Oncogenic activation of the RASRAF signaling pathway impairs the response of metastatic colo.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.aacrjournals.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17363584</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been introduced for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We have reported recently that increased copy number of the EGFR can predict response to anti-EGFR mAbs and that patients might be selected for treatment based on EGFR copy number. Here, we show that mutations activating the RAS/RAF signaling pathway are also predictive and prognostic indicators in mCRC patients, being inversely correlated with response to anti-EGFR mAbs. In cellular models of CRCs, activation of the RAS signaling pathway by introduction of an activated K-RAS allele (Gly(12)Val) impairs the therapeutic effect of anti-EGFR mAbs. In cancer cells carrying constitutively active RAS, the pharmacologic inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade improves anti-EGFR treatment based on mAbs. These results have implications for the identification of patients who are likely to respond to anti-EGFR treatment. They also provide the rationale for combination therapies, targeted simultaneously to the EGFR and RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling pathways in CRC patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allegra, Carmen J</author><author>Jessup, J Milburn</author><author>Somerfield, Mark R</author><author>Hamilton, Stanley R</author><author>Hammond, Elizabeth H</author><author>Hayes, Daniel F</author><author>McAllister, Pamela K</author><author>Morton, Roscoe F</author><author>Schilsky, Richard L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>American Society of Clinical Oncology provisional clinical opinion: testing for KRAS gene mutations in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma to predict response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy.</title><secondary-title>Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>2091-6</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19188670</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JCO.2009.21.9170</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Allegra et al. - Journal of clinical oncology official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology - American Society o.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cap.org/POET.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19188670</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>PURPOSE An American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) provisional clinical opinion (PCO), offers timely clinical direction to ASCO's oncologists following publication or presentation of potentially practice-changing data from major studies. This PCO addresses the utility of KRAS gene mutation testing in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma to predict response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy with cetuximab or panitumumab (see Note). CLINICAL CONTEXT Recent results from phase II and III clinical trials demonstrate that patients with metastatic colorectal cancer benefit from therapy with monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR, when used either as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy. Retrospective subset analyses of the data from these trials strongly suggest that patients who have KRAS mutations detected in codon 12 or 13 do not benefit from this therapy. RECENT DATA Five randomized controlled trials of cetuximab or panitumumab have evaluated outcomes for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma in relation to KRAS mutational status as no mutation detected (wild type) or abnormal (mutated). Another five single-arm studies have retrospectively evaluated tumor response according to KRAS status. PROVISIONAL CLINICAL OPINION Based on systematic reviews of the relevant literature, all patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who are candidates for anti-EGFR antibody therapy should have their tumor tested for KRAS mutations in a CLIA-accredited laboratory. If KRAS mutation in codon 12 or 13 is detected, then patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma should not receive anti-EGFR antibody therapy as part of their treatment. NOTE ASCO's provisional clinical opinions (PCOs) reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and literature available at the time they are written, and are intended to assist physicians in clinical decision-making and identify questions and settings for further research. Due to the rapid flow of scientific information in oncology, new evidence may have emerged since the time a PCO was submitted for publication. PCOs are not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. PCOs cannot account for individual variation among patients, and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or other health care provider, relying on independent experience and knowledge of the patient, to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Accordingly, adherence to any PCO is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances. ASCO PCOs describe the use of procedures and therapies in clinical practice and cannot be assumed to apply to the use of these interventions in the context of clinical trials. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of ASCO's PCOs, or for any errors or omissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karapetis, Christos S</author><author>Khambata-Ford, Shirin</author><author>Jonker, Derek J</author><author>O'Callaghan, Chris J.</author><author>Tu, Dongsheng</author><author>Tebbutt, Niall C</author><author>Simes, R.

The mutation status of the K-ras gene in the tumor may affect the response to cetuximab and have treatment-independent prognostic value. METHODS We analyzed tumor samples, obtained from 394 of 572 patients (68.9%) with colorectal cancer who were randomly assigned to receive cetuximab plus best supportive care or best supportive care alone, to look for activating mutations in exon 2 of the K-ras gene. We assessed whether the mutation status of the K-ras gene was associated with survival in the cetuximab and supportive-care groups. RESULTS Of the tumors evaluated for K-ras mutations, 42.3% had at least one mutation in exon 2 of the gene. The effectiveness of cetuximab was significantly associated with K-ras mutation status (P=0.01 and P&lt;0.001 for the interaction of K-ras mutation status with overall survival and progression-free survival, respectively). In patients with wild-type K-ras tumors, treatment with cetuximab as compared with supportive care alone significantly improved overall survival (median, 9.5 vs. 4.8 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.74; P&lt;0.001) and progression-free survival (median, 3.7 months vs. 1.9 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.54; P&lt;0.001). Among patients with mutated K-ras tumors, there was no significant difference between those who were treated with cetuximab and those who received supportive care alone with respect to overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.98; P=0.89) or progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.99; P=0.96). In the group of patients receiving best supportive care alone, the mutation status of the K-ras gene was not significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 1.01; P=0.97). CONCLUSIONS Patients with a colorectal tumor bearing mutated K-ras did not benefit from cetuximab, whereas patients with a tumor bearing wild-type K-ras did benefit from cetuximab. The mutation status of the K-ras gene had no influence on survival among patients treated with best supportive care alone.

We find that PI3Kgamma is strongly and directly activated by H-Ras G12V in vivo or by GTPgammaS-loaded H-Ras in vitro. We have determined a crystal structure of a PI3Kgamma/Ras.GMPPNP complex. A critical loop in the Ras binding domain positions Ras so that it uses its switch I and switch II regions to bind PI3Kgamma. Mutagenesis shows that interactions with both regions are essential for binding PI3Kgamma. Ras also forms a direct contact with the PI3Kgamma catalytic domain. These unique Ras/PI3Kgamma interactions are likely to be shared by PI3Kalpha. The complex with Ras shows a change in the PI3K conformation that may represent an allosteric component of Ras activation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Freed, Daniel M.</author><author>Bessman, Nicholas J.</author><author>Kiyatkin, Anatoly</author><author>Salazar-Cavazos, Emanuel</author><author>Byrne, Patrick O.</author><author>Moore, Jason O.</author><author>Valley, Christopher C.</author><author>Ferguson, Kathryn M.</author><author>Leahy, Daniel J.</author><author>Lidke, Diane S.</author><author>Lemmon, Mark A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EGFR Ligands Differentially Stabilize Receptor Dimers to Specify Signaling Kinetics.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>683-695.e18</pages><volume>171</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>biased agonist</keyword><keyword>cell fate decision</keyword><keyword>crystallography</keyword><keyword>dimerization</keyword><keyword>growth factor</keyword><keyword>kinetic proofreading</keyword><keyword>negative feedback</keyword><keyword>phosphatase</keyword><keyword>receptor tyrosine kinase</keyword><keyword>signaling specificity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>28988771</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2017.09.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Freed et al. - Cell - EGFR Ligands Differentially Stabilize Receptor Dimers to Specify Signaling Kinetics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.09.017</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28988771</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5650921</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates many crucial cellular programs, with seven different activating ligands shaping cell signaling in distinct ways. Using crystallography and other approaches, we show how the EGFR ligands epiregulin (EREG) and epigen (EPGN) stabilize different dimeric conformations of the EGFR extracellular region. As a consequence, EREG or EPGN induce less stable EGFR dimers than EGF-making them partial agonists of EGFR dimerization. Unexpectedly, this weakened dimerization elicits more sustained EGFR signaling than seen with EGF, provoking responses in breast cancer cells associated with differentiation rather than proliferation. Our results reveal how responses to different EGFR ligands are defined by receptor dimerization strength and signaling dynamics. These findings have broad implications for understanding receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling specificity. Our results also suggest parallels between partial and/or biased agonism in RTKs and G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as new therapeutic opportunities for correcting RTK signaling output.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitchell, Ruth A.</author><author>Luwor, Rodney B.</author><author>Burgess, Antony W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidermal growth factor receptor: Structure-function informing the design of anticancer therapeutics.</title><secondary-title>Experimental cell research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental cell research</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><volume>371</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>EGF-family</keyword><keyword>EGFR-family</keyword><keyword>Membrane dynamics</keyword><keyword>Signaling</keyword><keyword>Targeting</keyword><keyword>Tyrosine kinase</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>30098332</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.yexcr.2018.08.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Mitchell, Luwor, Burgess - Experimental cell research - Epidermal growth factor receptor Structure-function informing the design.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2018.08.009</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098332</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Research on the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and the family of receptors (EGFR) has progressed rapidly in recent times. New crystal structures of the ectodomains with different ligands, the activation of the kinase domain through oligomerisation and the use of fluorescence techniques have revealed profound conformational changes on ligand binding. The control of cell signaling from the EGFR-family is complex, with heterodimerisation, ligand affinity and signaling cross-talk influencing cellular outcomes. Analysis of tissue homeostasis indicates that the control of pro-ligand processing is likely to be as important as receptor activation events. Several members of the EGFR-family are overexpressed and/or mutated in cancer cells. The perturbation of EGFR-family signaling drives the malignant phenotype of many cancers and both inhibitors and antagonists of signaling from these receptors have already produced therapeutic benefits for patients. The design of affibodies, antibodies, small molecule inhibitors and even immunotherapeutic drugs targeting the EGFR-family has yielded promising new approaches to improving outcomes for cancer patients. In this review, we describe recent discoveries which have increased our understanding of the structure and dynamics of signaling from the EGFR-family, the roles of ligand processing and receptor cross-talk. We discuss the relevance of these studies to the development of strategies for designing more effective targeted treatments for cancer patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schneeweis, Christian</author><author>Wirth, Matthias</author><author>Saur, Dieter</author><author>Reichert, Maximilian</author><author>Schneider, Günter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oncogenic KRAS and the EGFR loop in pancreatic carcinogenesis-A connection to licensing nodes.</title><secondary-title>Small GTPases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Small GTPases</full-title></periodical><pages>457-464</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>EGFR</keyword><keyword>MYC</keyword><keyword>autocrine signaling</keyword><keyword>kras</keyword><keyword>pancreatic cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>27880072</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/21541248.2016.1262935</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Schneeweis et al. - Small GTPases - Oncogenic KRAS and the EGFR loop in pancreatic carcinogenesis-A connection to licensing nodes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1080/21541248.2016.1262935</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27880072</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6205075</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>EGFR signaling has a critical role in oncogenic KRAS-driven tumorigenesis of the pancreas, whereas it is dispensable in other organs.

Two anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab, have become essential components in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Treatment with these anti-EGFR antibodies has shown definite benefits when administered in all treatment lines and is strongly recommended as the preferred regimen to prolong survival, especially when administered in the first- and third-lines. Recent efforts have revealed not only mechanisms responsible for resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies, including expanded RAS mutations as a negative predictive biomarker, but also the possibility of continuing anti-EGFR antibody treatment in combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore, the challenges associated with the pharmaceutical development of treatments for patients with mutant-type BRAF mCRC are ongoing. In this review, we provide an overview of the EGFR and RAS/RAF signaling pathway and antitumor activity, focusing on practical aspects such as established treatments including patient selection, treatment strategies, and future perspectives for drug development targeting the EGFR and RAS/RAF signaling pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lipsick, Joseph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A History of Cancer Research: Tyrosine Kinases.</title><secondary-title>Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30709881</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/cshperspect.a035592</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Lipsick - Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology - A History of Cancer Research Tyrosine Kinases.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30709881</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Proteins containing tyrosine kinase activity play critical roles in cancer signaling.

These trans-membrane proteins are activated following binding with peptide growth factors of the EGF-family of proteins. Evidence suggests that the EGFR is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different carcinoma types. The EGFR and EGF-like peptides are often over-expressed in human carcinomas, and in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that these proteins are able to induce cell transformation. Amplification of the EGFR gene and mutations of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain have been recently demonstrated to occur in carcinoma patients. Interestingly, both these genetic alterations of the EGFR are correlated with high probability to respond to anti-EGFR agents. However, ErbB proteins and their ligands form a complex system in which the interactions occurring between receptors and ligands affect the type and the duration of the intracellular signals that derive from receptor activation. In fact, proteins of the ErbB family form either homo- or hetero-dimers following ligand binding, each dimer showing different affinity for ligands and different signaling properties. In this regard, evidence suggests that cooperation of multiple ErbB receptors and cognate ligands is necessary to induce cell transformation. In particular, the growth and the survival of carcinoma cells appear to be sustained by a network of receptors/ligands of the ErbB family. This phenomenon is also important for therapeutic approaches, since the response to anti-EGFR agents might depend on the total level of expression of ErbB receptors and ligands in tumor cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manchado, Eusebio</author><author>Weissmueller, Susann</author><author>Morris, John P</author><author>Chen, Chi-Chao</author><author>Wullenkord, Ramona</author><author>Lujambio, Amaia</author><author>de Stanchina, Elisa</author><author>Poirier, John T</author><author>Gainor, Justin F</author><author>Corcoran, Ryan B</author><author>Engelman, Jeffrey A</author><author>Rudin, Charles M</author><author>Rosen, Neal</author><author>Lowe, Scott W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A combinatorial strategy for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>647-51</pages><volume>534</volume><issue>7609</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27338794</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature18600</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Manchado et al. - Nature - A combinatorial strategy for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://clinicaltrials.gov/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27338794</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4939262</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Therapeutic targeting of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma represents a major goal of clinical oncology. KRAS itself has proved difficult to inhibit, and the effectiveness of agents that target key KRAS effectors has been thwarted by activation of compensatory or parallel pathways that limit their efficacy as single agents. Here we take a systematic approach towards identifying combination targets for trametinib, a MEK inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, which acts downstream of KRAS to suppress signalling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Informed by a short-hairpin RNA screen, we show that trametinib provokes a compensatory response involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) that leads to signalling rebound and adaptive drug resistance. As a consequence, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 in combination with trametinib enhances tumour cell death in vitro and in vivo. This compensatory response shows distinct specificities: it is dominated by FGFR1 in KRAS-mutant lung and pancreatic cancer cells, but is not activated or involves other mechanisms in KRAS wild-type lung and KRAS-mutant colon cancer cells. Importantly, KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and patients’ tumours treated with trametinib show an increase in FRS2 phosphorylation, a biomarker of FGFR activation; this increase is abolished by FGFR1 inhibition and correlates with sensitivity to trametinib and FGFR inhibitor combinations. These results demonstrate that FGFR1 can mediate adaptive resistance to trametinib and validate a combinatorial approach for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blokzijl, Francis</author><author>de Ligt, Joep</author><author>Jager, Myrthe</author><author>Sasselli, Valentina</author><author>Roerink, Sophie</author><author>Sasaki, Nobuo</author><author>Huch, Meritxell</author><author>Boymans, Sander</author><author>Kuijk, Ewart</author><author>Prins, Pjotr</author><author>Nijman, Isaac J</author><author>Martincorena, Inigo</author><author>Mokry, Michal</author><author>Wiegerinck, Caroline L</author><author>Middendorp, Sabine</author><author>Sato, Toshiro</author><author>Schwank, Gerald</author><author>Nieuwenhuis, Edward E S</author><author>Verstegen, Monique M A</author><author>van der Laan, Luc J W</author><author>de Jonge, Jeroen</author><author>IJzermans, Jan N M</author><author>Vries, Robert G</author><author>van de Wetering, Marc</author><author>Stratton, Michael R</author><author>Clevers, Hans</author><author>Cuppen, Edwin</author><author>van Boxtel, Ruben</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tissue-specific mutation accumulation in human adult stem cells during life.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>260-264</pages><volume>538</volume><issue>7624</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27698416</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature19768</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Blokzijl et al. - Nature - Tissue-specific mutation accumulation in human adult stem cells during life.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19768.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27698416</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5536223</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The gradual accumulation of genetic mutations in human adult stem cells (ASCs) during life is associated with various age-related diseases, including cancer. Extreme variation in cancer risk across tissues was recently proposed to depend on the lifetime number of ASC divisions, owing to unavoidable random mutations that arise during DNA replication. However, the rates and patterns of mutations in normal ASCs remain unknown. Here we determine genome-wide mutation patterns in ASCs of the small intestine, colon and liver of human donors with ages ranging from 3 to 87 years by sequencing clonal organoid cultures derived from primary multipotent cells. Our results show that mutations accumulate steadily over time in all of the assessed tissue types, at a rate of approximately 40 novel mutations per year, despite the large variation in cancer incidence among these tissues. Liver ASCs, however, have different mutation spectra compared to those of the colon and small intestine. Mutational signature analysis reveals that this difference can be attributed to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine residues in the colon and small intestine, probably reflecting their high ASC division rate. In liver, a signature with an as-yet-unknown underlying mechanism is predominant. Mutation spectra of driver genes in cancer show high similarity to the tissue-specific ASC mutation spectra, suggesting that intrinsic mutational processes in ASCs can initiate tumorigenesis. Notably, the inter-individual variation in mutation rate and spectra are low, suggesting tissue-specific activity of common mutational processes throughout life.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sack, Laura Magill</author><author>Davoli, Teresa</author><author>Li, Mamie Z</author><author>Li, Yuyang</author><author>Xu, Qikai</author><author>Naxerova, Kamila</author><author>Wooten, Eric C.</author><author>Bernardi, Ronald J.</author><author>Martin, Timothy D.</author><author>Chen, Ting</author><author>Leng, Yumei</author><author>Liang, Anthony C.</author><author>Scorsone, Kathleen A.</author><author>Westbrook, Thomas F.</author><author>Wong, Kwok-Kin</author><author>Elledge, Stephen J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Profound Tissue Specificity in Proliferation Control Underlies Cancer Drivers and Aneuploidy Patterns.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>499-514.e23</pages><volume>173</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>KRTAP</keyword><keyword>ORF screens</keyword><keyword>SCNA</keyword><keyword>aneuploidy</keyword><keyword>cancer drivers</keyword><keyword>gain of function screens</keyword><keyword>genetic screens</keyword><keyword>proliferation</keyword><keyword>tissue specificity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>29576454</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.037</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Sack et al. - Cell - Profound Tissue Specificity in Proliferation Control Underlies Cancer Drivers and Aneuploidy Patterns.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.037</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29576454</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Genomics has provided a detailed structural description of the cancer genome. Identifying oncogenic drivers that work primarily through dosage changes is a current challenge. Unrestrained proliferation is a critical hallmark of cancer. We constructed modular, barcoded libraries of human open reading frames (ORFs) and performed screens for proliferation regulators in multiple cell types. Approximately 10% of genes regulate proliferation, with most performing in an unexpectedly highly tissue-specific manner. Proliferation drivers in a given cell type showed specific enrichment in somatic copy number changes (SCNAs) from cognate tumors and helped predict aneuploidy patterns in those tumors, implying that tissue-type-specific genetic network architectures underlie SCNA and driver selection in different cancers. In vivo screening confirmed these results. We report a substantial contribution to the catalog of SCNA-associated cancer drivers, identifying 147 amplified and 107 deleted genes as potential drivers, and derive insights about the genetic network architecture of aneuploidy in tumors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shendure, Jay</author><author>Findlay, Gregory M.</author><author>Snyder, Matthew W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic Medicine-Progress, Pitfalls, and Promise.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>45-57</pages><volume>177</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>30901547</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Shendure, Findlay, Snyder - Cell - Genomic Medicine-Progress, Pitfalls, and Promise.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.003</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901547</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In the wake of the Human Genome Project (HGP), strong expectations were set for the timeline and impact of genomics on medicine-an anticipated transformation in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.

They primarily act as signalling relays downstream of RAS, and their close ties to cancer have fuelled a large number of studies. However, we still lack a systems-level understanding of their regulation and mode of action. The recent discovery that the catalytic activity of RAF depends on an allosteric mechanism driven by kinase domain dimerization is providing a vital new piece of information towards a comprehensive model of RAF function. The fact that current RAF inhibitors unexpectedly induce ERK signalling by stimulating RAF dimerization also calls for a deeper structural characterization of this family of kinases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Das, Shaoli</author><author>Deng, Xiang</author><author>Camphausen, Kevin</author><author>Shankavaram, Uma</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DiscoverSL: an R package for multi-omic data driven prediction of synthetic lethality in cancers.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>701-702</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30059974</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bty673</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Das et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - DiscoverSL an R package for multi-omic data driven prediction of synthetic lethal.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://watermark.silverchair.com/bty673.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAmkwggJlBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJWMIICUgIBADCCAksGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM6e9RPwU1om0SHtGDAgEQgIICHGPSdvuuzZG6zEqcrny6W09TJWNK8hkkpPXBMMbUMqxGQMBi</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>SUMMARY Synthetic lethality is a state when simultaneous loss of two genes is lethal to a cancer cell, while the loss of the individual genes is not. We developed an R package DiscoverSL to predict and visualize synthetic lethality in cancers using multi-omic cancer data. Mutation, copy number alteration and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project were combined to develop a multi-parametric Random Forest classifier. The effects of selectively targeting the predicted synthetic lethal genes is tested in silico using shRNA and drug screening data from cancer cell line databases. The clinical outcome in patients with mutation in primary gene and over/under-expression in the synthetic lethal gene is evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The method helps to identify new therapeutic approaches by exploiting the concept of synthetic lethality.

Additionally, many GNAS-mutated tumors have concurrent mutations in the Ras/Raf pathway. The clinicopathologic features of GNAS-mutated lung carcinomas, however, have not yet been characterized. Primary lung carcinomas from Brigham and Women's Hospital (n=1282) or Massachusetts General Hospital (n=1070) were genotyped on a targeted massively parallel sequencing panel of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes including GNAS. Clinical and pathological features were reviewed, and TTF-1 immunohistochemistry was performed when material was available. Nineteen lung adenocarcinomas with hotspot GNAS mutations were identified (19/2352, 0.8%) including 14 at codon 201 and 5 at codon 227. GNAS-mutated lung adenocarcinomas occurred predominantly in female patients (16/19, 84%). Ten (10) were classified as invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas (IMA), and nine (9) were non-mucinous adenocarcinomas. All IMAs had GNAS codon 201 mutations and concurrent Ras/Raf pathway mutations (9 KRAS, 1 BRAF). No tumors with GNAS codon 227 mutations had mucinous histological features. 86% of GNAS-mutated non-mucinous adenocarcinomas (6/7) were positive for TTF-1 immunohistochemistry, while only 25% of GNAS-mutated IMAs (1/4) were positive for TTF-1. Patients with GNAS-mutated non-mucinous adenocarcinomas were more likely to have a history of smoking (9/9, 100%) compared to patients with GNAS-mutated IMAs (2/10, 20%) (P&lt;0.001). Hotspot GNAS mutations can occur in primary lung adenocarcinomas. When associated with concurrent mutations in the Ras/Raf pathway, these neoplasms often present as IMAs. GNAS mutations are not specific to neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, and clinicopathologic correlation is necessary in GNAS-mutated adenocarcinomas in the lung to determine the primary site of origin.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taki, K</author><author>Ohmuraya, M</author><author>Tanji, E</author><author>Komatsu, H</author><author>Hashimoto, D</author><author>Semba, K</author><author>Araki, K</author><author>Kawaguchi, Y</author><author>Baba, H</author><author>Furukawa, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GNAS(R201H) and Kras(G12D) cooperate to promote murine pancreatic tumorigenesis recapitulating human intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.</title><secondary-title>Oncogene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncogene</full-title></periodical><pages>2407-12</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26257060</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/onc.2015.294</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Taki et al. - Oncogene - GNAS(R201H) and Kras(G12D) cooperate to promote murine pancreatic tumorigenesis recapitulating human int.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/onc</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26257060</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), the most common pancreatic cystic neoplasm, is known to progress to invasive ductal adenocarcinoma. IPMNs commonly harbor activating somatic mutations in GNAS and KRAS, primarily GNAS(R201H) and KRAS(G12D). GNAS encodes the stimulatory G-protein α subunit (Gsα) that mediates a stimulatory signal to adenylyl cyclase to produce cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), subsequently activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. The GNAS(R201H) mutation results in constitutive activation of Gsα. To study the potential role of GNAS in pancreatic tumorigenesis in vivo, we generated lines of transgenic mice in which the transgene consisted of Lox-STOP-Lox (LSL)-GNAS(R201H) under the control of the CAG promoter (Tg(CAG-LSL-GNAS)). These mice were crossed with pancreatic transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a)-Cre mice (Ptf1a(Cre/+)), generating Tg(CAG-LSL-GNAS);Ptf1a(Cre/+) mice. This mouse line showed elevated cAMP levels, small dilated tubular complex formation, loss of acinar cells and fibrosis in the pancreas; however, no macroscopic tumorigenesis was apparent by 2 months of age. We then crossed Tg(CAG-LSL-GNAS);Ptf1a(Cre/+) mice with LSL-Kras(G12D) mice, generating Tg(CAG-LSL-GNAS);LSL-Kras(G12D);Ptf1a(Cre/+) mice. We used these mice to investigate a possible cooperative effect of GNAS(R201H) and Kras(G12D) in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Within 5 weeks, Tg(CAG-LSL-GNAS);LSL-Kras(G12D);Ptf1a(Cre/+) mice developed a cystic tumor consisting of marked dilated ducts lined with papillary dysplastic epithelia in the pancreas, which closely mimicked the human IPMN. Our data strongly suggest that activating mutations in GNAS and Kras cooperatively promote murine pancreatic tumorigenesis, which recapitulates IPMN. Our mouse model may serve as a unique in vivo platform to find biomarkers and effective drugs for diseases associated with GNAS mutations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Jian</author><author>Troyanskaya, Olga G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting effects of noncoding variants with deep learning-based sequence model.</title><secondary-title>Nature methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature methods</full-title></periodical><pages>931-4</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26301843</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nmeth.3547</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Zhou, Troyanskaya - Nature methods - Predicting effects of noncoding variants with deep learning-based sequence model.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26301843</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4768299</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Identifying functional effects of noncoding variants is a major challenge in human genetics.

Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions. This work thus provides valuable mathematical tools for interpreting and extracting learned features from feed-forward neural networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lundberg, Scott M</author><author>Erion, Gabriel G</author><author>Lee, Su-In</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Consistent Individualized Feature Attribution for Tree Ensembles</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Lundberg, Erion, Lee - Unknown - Consistent Individualized Feature Attribution for Tree Ensembles.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://github.com/slundberg/shap</url><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03888</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Interpreting predictions from tree ensemble methods such as gradient boosting machines and random forests is important, yet feature attribution for trees is often heuristic and not individualized for each prediction. Here we show that popular feature attribution methods are inconsistent, meaning they can lower a feature's assigned importance when the true impact of that feature actually increases. This is a fundamental problem that casts doubt on any comparison between features. To address it we turn to recent applications of game theory and develop fast exact tree solutions for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values, which are the unique consistent and locally accurate attribution values. We then extend SHAP values to interaction effects and define SHAP interaction values. We propose a rich visualization of individualized feature attributions that improves over classic attribution summaries and partial dependence plots, and a unique &quot;supervised&quot; clustering (clustering based on feature attributions). We demonstrate better agreement with human intuition through a user study, exponential improvements in run time, improved clustering performance, and better identification of influential features. An implementation of our algorithm has also been merged into XGBoost and LightGBM, see http://github.com/slundberg/shap for details.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kelley, David R</author><author>Snoek, Jasper</author><author>Rinn, John L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Basset: learning the regulatory code of the accessible genome with deep convolutional neural networks.</title><secondary-title>Genome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome research</full-title></periodical><pages>990-9</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27197224</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.200535.115</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Kelley, Snoek, Rinn - Genome research - Basset learning the regulatory code of the accessible genome with deep convolutional neur.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.200535.115.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27197224</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4937568</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely understood. Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance-deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alipanahi, Babak</author><author>Delong, Andrew</author><author>Weirauch, Matthew T</author><author>Frey, Brendan J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning.</title><secondary-title>Nature biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>831-8</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26213851</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nbt.3300</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Alipanahi et al. - Nature biotechnology - Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://tools.genes.toronto.edu/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26213851</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Knowing the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins is essential for developing models of the regulatory processes in biological systems and for identifying causal disease variants. Here we show that sequence specificities can be ascertained from experimental data with 'deep learning' techniques, which offer a scalable, flexible and unified computational approach for pattern discovery. Using a diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when training on in vitro data and testing on in vivo data. We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment. Specificities determined by DeepBind are readily visualized as a weighted ensemble of position weight matrices or as a 'mutation map' that indicates how variations affect binding within a specific sequence.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klauschen, F.</author><author>Müller, K-R</author><author>Binder, A.</author><author>Bockmayr, M.</author><author>Hägele, M.</author><author>Seegerer, P.</author><author>Wienert, S.</author><author>Pruneri, G.</author><author>de Maria, S.</author><author>Badve, S.</author><author>Michiels, S.</author><author>Nielsen, T.

Pathologists have therefore started to devise standardized visual approaches to quantify TILs for therapy prediction. However, despite successful standardization efforts visual TIL estimation is slow, with limited precision and lacks the ability to evaluate more complex properties such as TIL distribution patterns. Therefore, computational image analysis approaches are needed to provide standardized and efficient TIL quantification. Here, we discuss different automated TIL scoring approaches ranging from classical image segmentation, where cell boundaries are identified and the resulting objects classified according to shape properties, to machine learning-based approaches that directly classify cells without segmentation but rely on large amounts of training data. In contrast to conventional machine learning (ML) approaches that are often criticized for their &quot;black-box&quot; characteristics, we also discuss explainable machine learning. Such approaches render ML results interpretable and explain the computational decision-making process through high-resolution heatmaps that highlight TILs and cancer cells and therefore allow for quantification and plausibility checks in biomedical research and diagnostics.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pan, Xiaoyong</author><author>Shen, Hong-Bin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting RNA-protein binding sites and motifs through combining local and global deep convolutional neural networks.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>3427-3436</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29722865</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bty364</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Pan, Shen - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Predicting RNA-protein binding sites and motifs through combining local and global.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/34/20/3427/4990826</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29722865</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) take over 5-10% of the eukaryotic proteome and play key roles in many biological processes, e.g. gene regulation. Experimental detection of RBP binding sites is still time-intensive and high-costly. Instead, computational prediction of the RBP binding sites using patterns learned from existing annotation knowledge is a fast approach. From the biological point of view, the local structure context derived from local sequences will be recognized by specific RBPs. However, in computational modeling using deep learning, to our best knowledge, only global representations of entire RNA sequences are employed. So far, the local sequence information is ignored in the deep model construction process. Results In this study, we present a computational method iDeepE to predict RNA-protein binding sites from RNA sequences by combining global and local convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For the global CNN, we pad the RNA sequences into the same length. For the local CNN, we split a RNA sequence into multiple overlapping fixed-length subsequences, where each subsequence is a signal channel of the whole sequence. Next, we train deep CNNs for multiple subsequences and the padded sequences to learn high-level features, respectively. Finally, the outputs from local and global CNNs are combined to improve the prediction. iDeepE demonstrates a better performance over state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale datasets derived from CLIP-seq. We also find that the local CNN runs 1.8 times faster than the global CNN with comparable performance when using GPUs. Our results show that iDeepE has captured experimentally verified binding motifs. Availability and implementation https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepE.

Consequently, our inability to describe these relationships has led to LSTMs being characterized as black boxes. To this end, we introduce contextual decomposition (CD), an interpretation algorithm for analysing individual predictions made by standard LSTMs, without any changes to the underlying model. By decomposing the output of a LSTM, CD captures the contributions of combinations of words or variables to the final prediction of an LSTM. On the task of sentiment analysis with the Yelp and SST data sets, we show that CD is able to reliably identify words and phrases of contrasting sentiment, and how they are combined to yield the LSTM's final prediction. Using the phrase-level labels in SST, we also demonstrate that CD is able to successfully extract positive and negative negations from an LSTM, something which has not previously been done.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghosal, Sambuddha</author><author>Blystone, David</author><author>Singh, Asheesh K</author><author>Ganapathysubramanian, Baskar</author><author>Singh, Arti</author><author>Sarkar, Soumik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An explainable deep machine vision framework for plant stress phenotyping.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>4613-4618</pages><volume>115</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>explainable deep learning</keyword><keyword>machine learning</keyword><keyword>plant stress phenotyping</keyword><keyword>precision agriculture</keyword><keyword>resolving rater variabilities</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29666265</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1716999115</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Ghosal et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - An explainable deep machine vis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/18/4613.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29666265</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5939070</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Current approaches for accurate identification, classification, and quantification of biotic and abiotic stresses in crop research and production are predominantly visual and require specialized training. However, such techniques are hindered by subjectivity resulting from inter- and intrarater cognitive variability. This translates to erroneous decisions and a significant waste of resources. Here, we demonstrate a machine learning framework's ability to identify and classify a diverse set of foliar stresses in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] with remarkable accuracy. We also present an explanation mechanism, using the top-K high-resolution feature maps that isolate the visual symptoms used to make predictions. This unsupervised identification of visual symptoms provides a quantitative measure of stress severity, allowing for identification (type of foliar stress), classification (low, medium, or high stress), and quantification (stress severity) in a single framework without detailed symptom annotation by experts. We reliably identified and classified several biotic (bacterial and fungal diseases) and abiotic (chemical injury and nutrient deficiency) stresses by learning from over 25,000 images. The learned model is robust to input image perturbations, demonstrating viability for high-throughput deployment. We also noticed that the learned model appears to be agnostic to species, seemingly demonstrating an ability of transfer learning. The availability of an explainable model that can consistently, rapidly, and accurately identify and quantify foliar stresses would have significant implications in scientific research, plant breeding, and crop production. The trained model could be deployed in mobile platforms (e.g., unmanned air vehicles and automated ground scouts) for rapid, large-scale scouting or as a mobile application for real-time detection of stress by farmers and researchers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guidotti, Riccardo</author><author>Monreale, Anna</author><author>Ruggieri, Salvatore</author><author>Turini, Franco</author><author>Pedreschi, Dino</author><author>Giannotti, Fosca</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Survey Of Methods For Explaining Black Box Models</title><secondary-title>ACM Comput.

This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness sometimes at the cost of scarifying accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, delineating explicitly or implicitly its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ribeiro, Marco Tulio</author><author>Singh, Sameer</author><author>Guestrin, Carlos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>&quot;Why Should I Trust You?&quot;</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - KDD '16</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - KDD '16</full-title></periodical><pages>1135-1144</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>9781450342322</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/2939672.2939778</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Ribeiro, Singh, Guestrin - Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - K.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939778</url><url>http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2939672.2939778</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust in a model. Trust is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether or not to deploy a new model. Such understanding further provides insights into the model, which can be used to turn an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We further propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). The usefulness of explanations is shown via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects. Our explanations empower users in various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and detecting why a classifier should not be trusted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fouss, Francois</author><author>Pirotte, Alain</author><author>Renders, Jean-Michel</author><author>Saerens, Marco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Random-Walk Computation of Similarities between Nodes of a Graph with Application to Collaborative Recommendation</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>355-369</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Fiedler vector</keyword><keyword>Index Terms-Graph analysis</keyword><keyword>collaborative recommendation</keyword><keyword>graph and database mining</keyword><keyword>graph kernels</keyword><keyword>proximity measures</keyword><keyword>spectral clustering</keyword><keyword>statistical relational learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>10414347/07</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TKDE.2007.46</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Fouss et al. - IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering - Random-Walk Computation of Similarities between Nodes of a G.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://outobox.cs.umn.edu/Random_Walks_Collaborative_Recommendation_Fouss.pdf</url><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4072747/</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This work presents a new perspective on characterizing the similarity between elements of a database or, more generally, nodes of a weighted and undirected graph. It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, etc.) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connecting those elements increases and when the &quot;length&quot; of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Euclidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is a kernel matrix (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A principal component analysis (PCA) of the graph is introduced for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors in a manner that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the Euclidean commute-time distance. This graph PCA provides a nice interpretation to the &quot;Fiedler vector,&quot; widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative-recommendation task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called &quot;statistical relational learning&quot; framework, could also be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a relational database.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chandra, Ashok K.</author><author>Raghavan, Prabhakar</author><author>Ruzzo, Walter L.</author><author>Smolensky, Roman</author><author>Tiwari, Prasoon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The electrical resistance of a graph captures its commute and cover times</title><secondary-title>Computational Complexity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computational Complexity</full-title></periodical><pages>312-340</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Commute time</keyword><keyword>Cover time</keyword><keyword>Random walk</keyword><keyword>Resistance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF01270385</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://1996 - Chandra et al. - Computational Complexity - The electrical resistance of a graph captures its commute and cover times.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/80000/73062/p574-chandra.pdf?ip=128.103.224.4&amp;id=73062&amp;acc=ACTIVE SERVICE&amp;key=AA86BE8B6928DDC7.C82FBC3DCC335AD2.4D4702B0C3E38B35.4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;__acm__=1556023578_45303ef12840ce7bdd87023443c4240f</url><url>http://link.springer.com/</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>View ann-vertex,m-edge undirected graph as an electrical network with unit resistors as edges. We extend known relations between random walks and electrical networks by showing that resistance in this network is intimately connected with thelengths of random walks on the graph. For example, thecommute time between two verticess andt (the expected length of a random walk froms tot and back) is precisely characterized by the effective resistanceR st betweens andt: commute time=2mR st . As a corollary, thecover time (the expected length of a random walk visiting all vertices) is characterized by the maximum resistanceR in the graph to within a factor of logn:mR&lt;-cover time&lt;-O(mRlogn). For many graphs, the bounds on cover time obtained in this manner are better than those obtained from previous techniques such as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. In particular, we improve known bounds on cover times for high-degree graphs and expanders, and give new proofs of known results for multi-dimensional meshes. Moreover, resistance seems to provide an intuitively appealing and tractable approach to these problems.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klein, D J</author><author>Randić, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resistance distance</title><secondary-title>Journal of Mathematical Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Mathematical Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>81-95</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1993</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF01164627</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://1993 - Klein, Randić - Journal of Mathematical Chemistry - Resistance distance.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF01164627.pdf</url><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF01164627</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The theory of resistive electrical networks is invoked to develop a novel view: if fixed resistors are assigned to each edge of a connected graph, then the effective resistance between pairs of vertices is a graphical distance.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn the cis-regulatory grammars encoded in regulatory DNA sequences associated with transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility. Several feature attribution methods have been developed for estimating the predictive importance of individual features (nucleotides or motifs) in any input DNA sequence to its associated output prediction from a DNN model. However, these methods do not reveal higher-order feature interactions encoded by the models. Results We present a new method called Deep Feature Interaction Maps (DFIM) to efficiently estimate interactions between all pairs of features in any input DNA sequence. DFIM accurately identifies ground truth motif interactions embedded in simulated regulatory DNA sequences. DFIM identifies synergistic interactions between GATA1 and TAL1 motifs from in vivo TF binding models. DFIM reveals epistatic interactions involving nucleotides flanking the core motif of the Cbf1 TF in yeast from in vitro TF binding models. We also apply DFIM to regulatory sequence models of in vivo chromatin accessibility to reveal interactions between regulatory genetic variants and proximal motifs of target TFs as validated by TF binding quantitative trait loci. Our approach makes significant strides in improving the interpretability of deep learning models for genomics.

Findings were followed up in an additional 23,262 cases and 38,296 controls. We discovered a strongly protective 0.3% frequency variant signal at CHD1. In a combined meta-analysis of 125,478 individuals, we identified 40 new independent signals at P &lt; 5 × 10-8, bringing the number of known independent signals for CRC to ~100. New signals implicate lower-frequency variants, Krüppel-like factors, Hedgehog signaling, Hippo-YAP signaling, long noncoding RNAs and somatic drivers, and support a role for immune function. Heritability analyses suggest that CRC risk is highly polygenic, and larger, more comprehensive studies enabling rare variant analysis will improve understanding of biology underlying this risk and influence personalized screening strategies and drug development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yardımcı, Galip Gürkan</author><author>Ozadam, Hakan</author><author>Sauria, Michael E G</author><author>Ursu, Oana</author><author>Yan, Koon-Kiu</author><author>Yang, Tao</author><author>Chakraborty, Abhijit</author><author>Kaul, Arya</author><author>Lajoie, Bryan R</author><author>Song, Fan</author><author>Zhan, Ye</author><author>Ay, Ferhat</author><author>Gerstein, Mark</author><author>Kundaje, Anshul</author><author>Li, Qunhua</author><author>Taylor, James</author><author>Yue, Feng</author><author>Dekker, Job</author><author>Noble, William S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring the reproducibility and quality of Hi-C data.</title><secondary-title>Genome biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome biology</full-title></periodical><pages>57</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Animal Genetics and Genomics</keyword><keyword>Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Evolutionary Biology</keyword><keyword>Human Genetics</keyword><keyword>Microbial Genetics and Genomics</keyword><keyword>Plant Genetics and Genomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30890172</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13059-019-1658-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Yardımcı et al. - Genome biology - Measuring the reproducibility and quality of Hi-C data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1658-7</url><url>https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1658-7</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890172</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6423771</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Hi-C is currently the most widely used assay to investigate the 3D organization of the genome and to study its role in gene regulation, DNA replication, and disease. However, Hi-C experiments are costly to perform and involve multiple complex experimental steps; thus, accurate methods for measuring the quality and reproducibility of Hi-C data are essential to determine whether the output should be used further in a study. RESULTS Using real and simulated data, we profile the performance of several recently proposed methods for assessing reproducibility of population Hi-C data, including HiCRep, GenomeDISCO, HiC-Spector, and QuASAR-Rep. By explicitly controlling noise and sparsity through simulations, we demonstrate the deficiencies of performing simple correlation analysis on pairs of matrices, and we show that methods developed specifically for Hi-C data produce better measures of reproducibility. We also show how to use established measures, such as the ratio of intra- to interchromosomal interactions, and novel ones, such as QuASAR-QC, to identify low-quality experiments. CONCLUSIONS In this work, we assess reproducibility and quality measures by varying sequencing depth, resolution and noise levels in Hi-C data from 13 cell lines, with two biological replicates each, as well as 176 simulated matrices. Through this extensive validation and benchmarking of Hi-C data, we describe best practices for reproducibility and quality assessment of Hi-C experiments. We make all software publicly available at http://github.com/kundajelab/3DChromatin_ReplicateQC to facilitate adoption in the community.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wainberg, Michael</author><author>Sinnott-Armstrong, Nasa</author><author>Mancuso, Nicholas</author><author>Barbeira, Alvaro N</author><author>Knowles, David A</author><author>Golan, David</author><author>Ermel, Raili</author><author>Ruusalepp, Arno</author><author>Quertermous, Thomas</author><author>Hao, Ke</author><author>Björkegren, Johan L.

In this Perspective, we explore properties of TWAS as a potential approach to prioritize causal genes at GWAS loci, by using simulations and case studies of literature-curated candidate causal genes for schizophrenia, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and Crohn's disease. We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some likely to be non-causal, owing to sharing of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization with expression data from non-trait-related tissues or cell types, owing to substantial cross-cell-type variation in expression levels and eQTL strengths. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes more accurately than simple baselines. We suggest best practices for causal-gene prioritization with TWAS and discuss future opportunities for improvement. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using eQTL datasets to determine causal genes at GWAS loci.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shrikumar, Avanti</author><author>Prakash, Eva</author><author>Kundaje, Anshul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gkmexplain: Fast and Accurate Interpretation of Nonlinear Gapped k-mer Support Vector Machines Using Integrated Gradients</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>457606</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1101/457606</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Shrikumar, Prakash, Kundaje - bioRxiv - Gkmexplain Fast and Accurate Interpretation of Nonlinear Gapped k-mer Support Vector Mach.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/457606</url><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/06/457606.full.pdf+html</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Support Vector Machines with gapped k-mer kernels (gkm-SVMs) have been used to learn predictive models of regulatory DNA sequence. However, interpreting predictive sequence patterns learned by gkm-SVMs can be challenging. Existing interpretation methods such as deltaSVM, in-silico mutagenesis (ISM), or SHAP either do not scale well or make limiting assumptions about the model that can produce misleading results when the gkm kernel is combined with nonlinear kernels. Here, we propose gkmexplain: a novel approach inspired by the method of Integrated Gradients for interpreting gkm-SVM models. Using simulated regulatory DNA sequences, we show that gkmexplain identifies predictive patterns with high accuracy while avoiding pitfalls of deltaSVM and ISM and being orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than SHAP. We use a novel motif discovery method called TF-MoDISco to recover consolidated TF motifs from gkm-SVM models of in vivo TF binding by aggregating predictive patterns identified by gkmexplain. Finally, we find that mutation impact scores derived through gkmexplain using gkm-SVM models of chromatin accessibility in lymphoblastoid cell-lines consistently outperform deltaSVM and ISM at identifying regulatory genetic variants (dsQTLs).

Here we present DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its 'reference activation' and assigns contribution scores according to the difference. By optionally giving separate consideration to positive and negative contributions, DeepLIFT can also reveal dependencies which are missed by other approaches. Scores can be computed efficiently in a single backward pass. We apply DeepLIFT to models trained on MNIST and simulated genomic data, and show significant advantages over gradient-based methods. A detailed video tutorial on the method is at http://goo.gl/qKb7pL and code is at http://goo.gl/RM8jvH.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tycko, Josh</author><author>Wainberg, Michael</author><author>Marinov, Georgi K</author><author>Ursu, Oana</author><author>Hess, Gaelen T</author><author>Ego, Braeden K</author><author>Aradhana</author><author>Li, Amy</author><author>Truong, Alisa</author><author>Trevino, Alexandro E</author><author>Spees, Kaitlyn</author><author>Yao, David</author><author>Kaplow, Irene M</author><author>Greenside, Peyton G</author><author>Morgens, David W</author><author>Phanstiel, Douglas H</author><author>Snyder, Michael P</author><author>Bintu, Lacramioara</author><author>Greenleaf, William J</author><author>Kundaje, Anshul</author><author>Bassik, Michael C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification and mitigation of pervasive off-target activity in CRISPR-Cas9 screens for essential non-coding elements</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>520569</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/520569</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Tycko et al. - bioRxiv - Identification and mitigation of pervasive off-target activity in CRISPR-Cas9 screens for essential non-.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/520569</url><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/01/18/520569</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens have recently emerged as a powerful method for functionally characterizing regulatory elements in the non-coding genome, but off-target effects in these experiments have not been systematically evaluated. Here, we conducted a genome-scale screen for essential CTCF loop anchors in the K562 leukemia cell line. Surprisingly, the primary drivers of signal in this screen were single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with low specificity scores. After removing these guides, we found that there were no CTCF loop anchors critical for cell growth. We also observed this effect in an independent screen fine-mapping the core motifs in enhancers of the GATA1 gene. We then conducted screens in parallel with CRISPRi and CRISPRa, which do not induce DNA damage, and found that an unexpected and distinct set of off-targets also caused strong confounding growth effects with these epigenome-editing platforms. Promisingly, strict filtering of CRISPRi libraries using GuideScan specificity scores removed these confounded sgRNAs and allowed for the identification of essential enhancers, which we validated extensively. Together, our results show off-target activity can severely limit identification of essential functional motifs by active Cas9, while strictly filtered CRISPRi screens can be reliably used for assaying larger regulatory elements.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yen, Luh</author><author>Saerens, Marco</author><author>Mantrach, Amin</author><author>Shimbo, Masashi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A family of dissimilarity measures between nodes generalizing both the shortest-path and the commute-time distances</title><secondary-title>Proceeding of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining - KDD 08</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceeding of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining - KDD 08</full-title></periodical><pages>785</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>New York, New York, USA</pub-location><publisher>ACM Press</publisher><isbn>9781605581934</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/1401890.1401984</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2008 - Yen et al. - Proceeding of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining - KDD 08 - A famil.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.569.8474&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</url><url>http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1401890.1401984</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This work introduces a new family of link-based dissimilarity mea- sures between nodes of a weighted directed graph. This measure, called the randomized shortest-path (RSP) dissimilarity, depends on a parameter θ and has the interesting property of reducing, on one end, to the standard shortest-path distance when θ is large and, on the other end, to the commute-time (or resistance) distance when θ is small (near zero). Intuitively, it corresponds to the expected cost incurred by a random walker in order to reach a destination node from a starting node while maintaining a constant entropy (related to θ) spread in the graph. The parameter θ is therefore bi- asing gradually the simple random walk on the graph towards the shortest-path policy. By adopting a statistical physics approach and computing a sum over all the possible paths (discrete path integral), it is shown that the RSP dissimilarity from every node to a partic- ular node of interest can be computed efficiently by solving two linear systems of n equations, where n is the number of nodes. On the other hand, the dissimilarity between every couple of nodes is obtained by inverting an n × n matrix. The proposed measure can be used for various graph mining tasks such as computing be- tweenness centrality, finding dense communities, etc, as shown in the experimental section.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ceriani, Lidia</author><author>Verme, Paolo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The origins of the Gini index: Extracts from Variabilità e Mutabilità (1912) by Corrado Gini</title><secondary-title>Journal of Economic Inequality</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Economic Inequality</full-title></periodical><pages>421-443</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Corrado Gini</keyword><keyword>Gini index</keyword><keyword>Income distribution</keyword><keyword>Inequality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10888-011-9188-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Ceriani, Verme - Journal of Economic Inequality - The origins of the Gini index Extracts from Variabilità e Mutabilità (1912) b.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.umass.edu/wsp/statistics/tales/gini.html</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The scope of this paper is to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Gini index by providing the original formulae.

This article provides selected extracts of Part I of the book dedicated to measures of variability. We find that Gini proposed no less than 13 formulations of his index, none of which is known today to the large public.

The structural and functional role of the C-terminal extension of small heat shock proteins, particularly of alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins, is not well understood. We have swapped the C-terminal extensions between alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins and generated two novel chimeric proteins, alphaABc and alphaBAc. We have investigated the domain-swapped chimeras for structural and functional alterations. We have used thermal and non-thermal models of protein aggregation and found that the chimeric alphaB with the C-terminal extension of alphaA-crystallin, alphaBAc, exhibits dramatically enhanced chaperone-like activity. Interestingly, however, the chimeric alphaA with the C-terminal extension of alphaB-crystallin, alphaABc, has almost lost its activity. Pyrene solubilization and bis-1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate binding studies show that alphaBAc exhibits more solvent-exposed hydrophobic pockets than alphaA, alphaB, or alphaABc. Significant tertiary structural changes are revealed by tryptophan fluorescence and near-UV CD studies upon swapping the C-terminal extensions. The far-UV CD spectrum of alphaBAc differs from that of alphaB-crystallin whereas that of alphaABc overlaps with that of alphaA-crystallin. Gel filtration chromatography shows alteration in the size of the proteins upon swapping the C-terminal extensions. Our study demonstrates that the unstructured C-terminal extensions play a crucial role in the structure and chaperone activity, in addition to generally believed electrostatic &quot;solubilizer&quot; function.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yamashita, Arisa</author><author>Taniwaki, Tatsuya</author><author>Kaikoi, Yuka</author><author>Yamazaki, Tetsuo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protective role of the endoplasmic reticulum protein mitsugumin23 against ultraviolet C-induced cell death.</title><secondary-title>FEBS letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FEBS letters</full-title></periodical><pages>1299-303</pages><volume>587</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Cell death</keyword><keyword>DNA damage</keyword><keyword>Endoplasmic reticulum</keyword><keyword>MG23</keyword><keyword>Ultraviolet light</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Federation of European Biochemical Societies</publisher><accession-num>23542032</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.febslet.2013.03.024</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Yamashita et al. - FEBS letters - Protective role of the endoplasmic reticulum protein mitsugumin23 against ultraviolet C-induced.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.03.024</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23542032</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) operates in adaptive responses to various stresses, dictating cell fate. Here we show that knockdown of the ER protein mitsugumin23 (MG23) enhances cell death induced by ultraviolet C (UVC), which causes DNA damage. The small heat shock protein αB-crystallin (αBC) is identified as a MG23 binding molecule and its knockdown facilitates death of UVC-exposed cells. Conversely, αBC lowered UVC sensitivity when expressed as an ER-anchored form. Taken together, the results suggest that MG23 plays a protective role against UVC by accumulating αBC in the close vicinity of the ER.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mao, Y-W</author><author>Liu, J-P</author><author>Xiang, H</author><author>Li, D W-C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins bind to Bax and Bcl-X(S) to sequester their translocation during staurosporine-induced apoptosis.</title><secondary-title>Cell death and differentiation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell death and differentiation</full-title></periodical><pages>512-26</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Bax</keyword><keyword>Bcl-X S</keyword><keyword>R116C</keyword><keyword>R120G</keyword><keyword>aA-crystallin</keyword><keyword>aB-crystallin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><isbn>5074379636</isbn><accession-num>14752512</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/sj.cdd.4401384</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2004 - Mao et al. - Cell death and differentiation - Human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins bind to Bax and Bcl-X(S) to sequester their tr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/cdd</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14752512</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>AlphaA- and alphaB-crystallins are distinct antiapoptotic regulators. Regarding the antiapoptotic mechanisms, we have recently demonstrated that alphaB-crystallin interacts with the procaspase-3 and partially processed procaspase-3 to repress caspase-3 activation. Here, we demonstrate that human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins prevent staurosporine-induced apoptosis through interactions with members of the Bcl-2 family. Using GST pulldown assays and coimmunoprecipitations, we demonstrated that alpha-crystallins bind to Bax and Bcl-X(S) both in vitro and in vivo. Human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins display similar affinity to both proapoptotic regulators, and so are true with their antiapoptotic ability tested in human lens epithelial cells, human retina pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) and rat embryonic myocardium cells (H9c2) under treatment of staurosporine, etoposide or sorbitol. Two prominent mutants, R116C in alphaA-crystallin and R120G, in alphaB-crystallin display much weaker affinity to Bax and Bcl-X(S). Through the interaction, alpha-crystallins prevent the translocation of Bax and Bcl-X(S) from cytosol into mitochondria during staurosporine-induced apoptosis. As a result, alpha-crystallins preserve the integrity of mitochondria, restrict release of cytochrome c, repress activation of caspase-3 and block degradation of PARP. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel antiapoptotic mechanism for alpha-crystallins.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Conrad, Tim O F</author><author>Genzel, Martin</author><author>Cvetkovic, Nada</author><author>Wulkow, Niklas</author><author>Leichtle, Alexander</author><author>Vybiral, Jan</author><author>Kutyniok, Gitta</author><author>Schütte, Christof</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sparse Proteomics Analysis - a compressed sensing-based approach for feature selection and classification of high-dimensional proteomics mass spectrometry data.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>160</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Biomarker</keyword><keyword>Classification</keyword><keyword>Clinical data</keyword><keyword>Compressed sensing</keyword><keyword>Feature selection</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword><keyword>Mass spectrometry</keyword><keyword>Proteomics</keyword><keyword>Sparsity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28274197</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-017-1565-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Conrad et al. - BMC bioinformatics - Sparse Proteomics Analysis - a compressed sensing-based approach for feature selection and c.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-017-1565-4</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28274197</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5343371</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND High-throughput proteomics techniques, such as mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches, produce very high-dimensional data-sets. In a clinical setting one is often interested in how mass spectra differ between patients of different classes, for example spectra from healthy patients vs. spectra from patients having a particular disease. Machine learning algorithms are needed to (a) identify these discriminating features and (b) classify unknown spectra based on this feature set. Since the acquired data is usually noisy, the algorithms should be robust against noise and outliers, while the identified feature set should be as small as possible. RESULTS We present a new algorithm, Sparse Proteomics Analysis (SPA), based on the theory of compressed sensing that allows us to identify a minimal discriminating set of features from mass spectrometry data-sets. We show (1) how our method performs on artificial and real-world data-sets, (2) that its performance is competitive with standard (and widely used) algorithms for analyzing proteomics data, and (3) that it is robust against random and systematic noise. We further demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to two previously published clinical data-sets.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Brien, Jonathon J</author><author>Gunawardena, Harsha P</author><author>Paulo, Joao A</author><author>Chen, Xian</author><author>Ibrahim, Joseph G</author><author>Gygi, Steven P</author><author>Qaqish, Bahjat F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of nonignorable missing data on label-free mass spectrometry proteomics experiments.</title><secondary-title>The annals of applied statistics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The annals of applied statistics</full-title></periodical><pages>2075-2095</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Bayesian Inference</keyword><keyword>Data Dependent Analysis</keyword><keyword>Estimable Contrasts</keyword><keyword>Imputation</keyword><keyword>Interval Coverage</keyword><keyword>Selection Model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30473739</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1214/18-AOAS1144</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - O'Brien et al. - The annals of applied statistics - The effects of nonignorable missing data on label-free mass spectrometry prot.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1214/18-AOAS1144</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473739</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6249692</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>An idealized version of a label-free discovery mass spectrometry proteomics experiment would provide absolute abundance measurements for a whole proteome, across varying conditions. Unfortunately, this ideal is not realized. Measurements are made on peptides requiring an inferential step to obtain protein level estimates. The inference is complicated by experimental factors that necessitate relative abundance estimation and result in widespread non-ignorable missing data. Relative abundance on the log scale takes the form of parameter contrasts. In a complete-case analysis, contrast estimates may be biased by missing data and a substantial amount of useful information will often go unused. To avoid problems with missing data, many analysts have turned to single imputation solutions. Unfortunately, these methods often create further difficulties by hiding inestimable contrasts, preventing the recovery of interblock information and failing to account for imputation uncertainty. To mitigate many of the problems caused by missing values, we propose the use of a Bayesian selection model. Our model is tested on simulated data, real data with simulated missing values, and on a ground truth dilution experiment where all of the true relative changes are known. The analysis suggests that our model, compared with various imputation strategies and complete-case analyses, can increase accuracy and provide substantial improvements to interval coverage.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kumar, Prateek</author><author>Henikoff, Steven</author><author>Ng, Pauline C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting the effects of coding non-synonymous variants on protein function using the SIFT algorithm.</title><secondary-title>Nature protocols</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature protocols</full-title></periodical><pages>1073-81</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19561590</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nprot.2009.86</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Kumar, Henikoff, Ng - Nature protocols - Predicting the effects of coding non-synonymous variants on protein function using the S.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pantherdb.org/tools/csnpScoreForm.jsp</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561590</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The effect of genetic mutation on phenotype is of significant interest in genetics. The type of genetic mutation that causes a single amino acid substitution (AAS) in a protein sequence is called a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP). An nsSNP could potentially affect the function of the protein, subsequently altering the carrier's phenotype. This protocol describes the use of the 'Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant' (SIFT) algorithm in predicting whether an AAS affects protein function. To assess the effect of a substitution, SIFT assumes that important positions in a protein sequence have been conserved throughout evolution and therefore substitutions at these positions may affect protein function. Thus, by using sequence homology, SIFT predicts the effects of all possible substitutions at each position in the protein sequence. The protocol typically takes 5-20 min, depending on the input. SIFT is available as an online tool (http://sift.jcvi.org).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adzhubei, Ivan A</author><author>Schmidt, Steffen</author><author>Peshkin, Leonid</author><author>Ramensky, Vasily E</author><author>Gerasimova, Anna</author><author>Bork, Peer</author><author>Kondrashov, Alexey S</author><author>Sunyaev, Shamil R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A method and server for predicting damaging missense mutations.</title><secondary-title>Nature methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature methods</full-title></periodical><pages>248-9</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Cambridge Univ.

We used interventional data on steady-state gene expression levels of known single-gene knock-out experiments as the gold standard for determining the causal effects. We applied IDA, as well as Lasso and Elastic-net, to the observational datasets and evaluated how well the resulting top q predicted effects (q = 10 for the networks of size 10 and q = 25 for the networks of size 100) corresponded to the top m percentage (m = 5 or 10) of the effects as computed from the interventional data (Supplementary Methods). We counted the number of networks in which the partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pAUC) was better than random guessing at significance level a = 0.01 for both values of m (Supplementary Methods). By this measure, IDA was at least as good as Lasso and Elastic-net for all four possible combinations of the type of observational data (multifactorial or time series) and the size of the networks (10 or 100 genes). The difference was largest for the multifactorial data on the networks of size 10, where IDA was substantially better than Lasso and Elastic-net for three of the five networks (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2). For instance, in this setting with m = 10 and q = 10, IDA found 4, 4, 5, 1 and 2 true positives for the five different networks, whereas Lasso found 1, 1, 0, 1 and 2 true positives and Elastic-net found 3, 1, 0, 1 and 1 true positives. The results presented here on S. cerevisiae and the DREAM4 data are proof-of-concept results that IDA can predict the stron-gest causal effects in potentially large-scale biological systems by using only observational data. In particular, the results on S. cerevisiae demonstrate that we were able to do this in a chal-lenging real-world setting where the number of variables (5,361) was much larger than the sample size (63) and the variables were substantially disturbed by noise. As IDA is supported by math-ematical theory, we expect the results presented here to generalize to other problems. Of course, statistical predictions based on observational data can never replace intervention experiments. In fact, whenever possible, IDA predictions should be followed up by intervention experiments. In this way, the predictions can serve as a new tool for the design of experiments, as they indicate which interven-tions are likely to show a large effect. Software for IDA is available in the open source R-package pcalg (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcalg/index. html). To the Editor: Applications of rapidly advancing sequencing technology exacerbate the need to interpret individual sequence variants. Sequencing of phenotyped clinical subjects will soon become a method of choice in studies of the genetic causes of Mendelian and complex diseases. New exon-capture techniques will direct sequencing efforts to the most informative and easily interpretable protein-coding fraction of the genome. Thus, the demand for computational predictions of the impact of protein sequence variants will continue to grow. Here we present a new method and the corresponding soft-ware tool, PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/, Supplementary Software), for predicting damaging effects of missense mutations. PolyPhen-2 is different from the earlier tool PolyPhen 1 in the set of predictive features, the alignment pipeline and the method of classification (Fig. 1a). PolyPhen-2 uses eight sequence-based and three structure-based predictive features (Supplementary Table 1), which were selected automati-cally by an iterative greedy algorithm (Supplementary Methods). The majority of these features involve comparison of a property of the wild-type (ancestral, normal) allele and the correspond-ing property of the mutant (derived, disease-causing) allele. The alignment pipeline selects a set of homologous sequences using a clustering algorithm and then constructs and refines its multiple alignment (Supplementary Fig. 1). The most informa-tive predictive features characterize how likely the two human alleles are to occupy the site given the pattern of amino-acid replacements in the multiple-sequence alignment; how distant the protein harboring the first deviation from the human wild-type allele is from the human protein; and whether the mutant allele originated at a hypermutable site 2 . The functional impor-tance of an allele replacement is predicted from its individual features (Supplementary Figs. 2–4) by a naive Bayes classifier (Supplementary Methods). We used two pairs of datasets to train and test PolyPhen-2. We compiled the first pair, HumDiv, from all 3,155 damaging alleles annotated in the UniProt database as causing human Mendelian diseases and affecting protein stability or function, together with 6,321 differences between human proteins and their closely related mammalian homologs, assumed to be nondamaging (Supplementary Methods). The second pair, HumVar 3 , consists of all the 13,032 human disease-causing mutations from UniProt and 8,946 human nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymor-phisms (nsSNPs) without annotated involvement in disease, which we treated as nondamaging. We found that PolyPhen-2 performance, as presented by its receiver operating characteristic curves, was consistently superior compared to that of PolyPhen (Fig. 1b) and it also compared favorably with that of three other popular prediction tools 4–6 (Fig. 1c). For a false positive rate of 20%, PolyPhen-2 achieved true positive prediction rates of 92% and 73% on HumDiv and HumVar datasets, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). One reason for the lower accuracy of predictions on HumVar is that nsSNPs assumed to be nondamaging in the HumVar dataset included a sizable fraction of mildly deleterious alleles. In con-trast, most amino-acid replacements assumed nondamaging in</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Squartini, Tiziano</author><author>Caldarelli, Guido</author><author>Cimini, Giulio</author><author>Gabrielli, Andrea</author><author>Garlaschelli, Diego</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reconstruction methods for networks: The case of economic and financial systems</title><secondary-title>Physics Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physics Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-47</pages><volume>757</volume><keywords><keyword>Economic and financial networks</keyword><keyword>Entropy maximization</keyword><keyword>Network reconstruction</keyword><keyword>Statistical inference</keyword><keyword>Systemic risk evaluation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.physrep.2018.06.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Squartini et al. - Physics Reports - Reconstruction methods for networks The case of economic and financial systems.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2018.06.008</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0370157318301509</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The study of social, economic and biological systems is often (when not always) limited by the partial information about the structure of the underlying networks. An example of paramount importance is provided by financial systems: information on the interconnections between financial institutions is privacy-protected, dramatically reducing the possibility of correctly estimating crucial systemic properties such as the resilience to the propagation of shocks. The need to compensate for the scarcity of data, while optimally employing the available information, has led to the birth of a research field known as network reconstruction. Since the latter has benefited from the contribution of researchers working in disciplines as different as mathematics, physics and economics, the results achieved so far are still scattered across heterogeneous publications. Most importantly, a systematic comparison of the network reconstruction methods proposed up to now is currently missing. This review aims at providing a unifying framework to present all these studies, mainly focusing on their application to economic and financial networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lees, J.

Here, we have generated a library of HeLa cell lines expressing 1,125 GFP-tagged proteins under near-endogenous control, which we used as input for a next-generation interaction survey. Using quantitative proteomics, we detect specific interactions, estimate interaction stoichiometries, and measure cellular abundances of interacting proteins. These three quantitative dimensions reveal that the protein network is dominated by weak, substoichiometric interactions that play a pivotal role in defining network topology. The minority of stable complexes can be identified by their unique stoichiometry signature. This study provides a rich interaction dataset connecting thousands of proteins and introduces a framework for quantitative network analysis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scarlett, Christopher J.</author><author>Salisbury, Elizabeth L.</author><author>Biankin, Andrew V.</author><author>Kench, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Precursor lesions in pancreatic cancer: morphological and molecular pathology.</title><secondary-title>Pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>183-200</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Pancreas</keyword><keyword>Pathology</keyword><keyword>Precursor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21436628</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/PAT.0b013e3283445e3a</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Scarlett et al. - Pathology - Precursor lesions in pancreatic cancer morphological and molecular pathology.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21436628</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and is the fourth most common cause of cancer related death in Western societies. In large part this is due to its typically late presentation, usually as locally advanced or metastatic disease. Identification of the non-invasive precursor lesions to pancreatic cancer raises the possibility of surgical treatment or chemoprevention at an early stage in the evolution of this disease, when more amenable to therapeutic interventions. Precursor lesions to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, in particular pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), have been recognised under a variety of synonyms for over 50 years. Over the past decade our understanding of the morphology, biological significance and molecular aberrations of these lesions has grown rapidly and there is now a widely accepted progression model integrating the accumulated morphological and molecular observations. Further progress is likely to be accelerated by improved mouse models of pancreatic cancer and by insight into the cancer genome gained by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), in which an Australian consortium is leading the pancreatic cancer initiative. This review also outlines the morphological and molecular features of the other two precursors of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, i.e., intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Hang</author><author>Gong, Xiu-Jun</author><author>Yu, Hua</author><author>Zhou, Chang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep Neural Network Based Predictions of Protein Interactions Using Primary Sequences.</title><secondary-title>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><pages>1923</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>convolution neural networks</keyword><keyword>long short-term memory neural networks</keyword><keyword>model generalization</keyword><keyword>protein–protein interaction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30071670</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/molecules23081923</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Li et al. - Molecules (Basel, Switzerland) - Deep Neural Network Based Predictions of Protein Interactions Using Primary Sequence.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30071670</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6222503</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Machine learning based predictions of protein⁻protein interactions (PPIs) could provide valuable insights into protein functions, disease occurrence, and therapy design on a large scale. The intensive feature engineering in most of these methods makes the prediction task more tedious and trivial. The emerging deep learning technology enabling automatic feature engineering is gaining great success in various fields. However, the over-fitting and generalization of its models are not yet well investigated in most scenarios. Here, we present a deep neural network framework (DNN-PPI) for predicting PPIs using features learned automatically only from protein primary sequences. Within the framework, the sequences of two interacting proteins are sequentially fed into the encoding, embedding, convolution neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network layers. Then, a concatenated vector of the two outputs from the previous layer is wired as the input of the fully connected neural network. Finally, the Adam optimizer is applied to learn the network weights in a back-propagation fashion. The different types of features, including semantic associations between amino acids, position-related sequence segments (motif), and their long- and short-term dependencies, are captured in the embedding, CNN and LSTM layers, respectively. When the model was trained on Pan's human PPI dataset, it achieved a prediction accuracy of 98.78% at the Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 97.57%. The prediction accuracies for six external datasets ranged from 92.80% to 97.89%, making them superior to those achieved with previous methods. When performed on Escherichia coli, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans datasets, DNN-PPI obtained prediction accuracies of 95.949%, 98.389%, and 98.669%, respectively. The performances in cross-species testing among the four species above coincided in their evolutionary distances. However, when testing Mus Musculus using the models from those species, they all obtained prediction accuracies of over 92.43%, which is difficult to achieve and worthy of note for further study. These results suggest that DNN-PPI has remarkable generalization and is a promising tool for identifying protein interactions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Jianjiong</author><author>Aksoy, Bülent Arman</author><author>Dogrusoz, Ugur</author><author>Dresdner, Gideon</author><author>Gross, Benjamin</author><author>Sumer, S Onur</author><author>Sun, Yichao</author><author>Jacobsen, Anders</author><author>Sinha, Rileen</author><author>Larsson, Erik</author><author>Cerami, Ethan</author><author>Sander, Chris</author><author>Schultz, Nikolaus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal.</title><secondary-title>Science signaling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science signaling</full-title></periodical><pages>pl1</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>269</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23550210</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/scisignal.2004088</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Gao et al. - Science signaling - Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://stke.sciencemag.org/</url><url>http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550210</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4160307</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://cbioportal.org) provides a Web resource for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing multidimensional cancer genomics data.

However, approaches relying on domains as features cannot be applied to proteins without any domain information. In this paper, we explore the contribution of pure amino acid composition (AAC) for protein interaction prediction. This simple feature, which is based on normalized counts of single or pairs of amino acids, is applicable to proteins from any sequenced organism and can be used to compensate for the lack of domain information. RESULTS AAC performed at par with protein interaction prediction based on domains on three yeast protein interaction datasets. Similar behavior was obtained using different classifiers, indicating that our results are a function of features and not of classifiers. In addition to yeast datasets, AAC performed comparably on worm and fly datasets. Prediction of interactions for the entire yeast proteome identified a large number of novel interactions, the majority of which co-localized or participated in the same processes. Our high confidence interaction network included both well-studied and uncharacterized proteins. Proteins with known function were involved in actin assembly and cell budding. Uncharacterized proteins interacted with proteins involved in reproduction and cell budding, thus providing putative biological roles for the uncharacterized proteins. CONCLUSION AAC is a simple, yet powerful feature for predicting protein interactions, and can be used alone or in conjunction with protein domains to predict new and validate existing interactions. More importantly, AAC alone performs at par with existing, but more complex, features indicating the presence of sequence-level information that is predictive of interaction, but which is not necessarily restricted to domains.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tuncbag, Nurcan</author><author>Gursoy, Attila</author><author>Nussinov, Ruth</author><author>Keskin, Ozlem</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting protein-protein interactions on a proteome scale by matching evolutionary and structural similarities at interfaces using PRISM.</title><secondary-title>Nature protocols</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature protocols</full-title></periodical><pages>1341-54</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21886100</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nprot.2011.367</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Tuncbag et al. - Nature protocols - Predicting protein-protein interactions on a proteome scale by matching evolutionary and stru.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21886100</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27074302</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Prediction of protein-protein interactions at the structural level on the proteome scale is important because it allows prediction of protein function, helps drug discovery and takes steps toward genome-wide structural systems biology. We provide a protocol (termed PRISM, protein interactions by structural matching) for large-scale prediction of protein-protein interactions and assembly of protein complex structures. The method consists of two components: rigid-body structural comparisons of target proteins to known template protein-protein interfaces and flexible refinement using a docking energy function. The PRISM rationale follows our observation that globally different protein structures can interact via similar architectural motifs. PRISM predicts binding residues by using structural similarity and evolutionary conservation of putative binding residue 'hot spots'. Ultimately, PRISM could help to construct cellular pathways and functional, proteome-scale annotation. PRISM is implemented in Python and runs in a UNIX environment. The program accepts Protein Data Bank-formatted protein structures and is available at http://prism.ccbb.ku.edu.tr/prism_protocol/.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keskin, Ozlem</author><author>Tuncbag, Nurcan</author><author>Gursoy, Attila</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions from the Molecular to the Proteome Level.</title><secondary-title>Chemical reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical reviews</full-title></periodical><pages>4884-909</pages><volume>116</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27074302</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00683</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Keskin, Tuncbag, Gursoy - Chemical reviews - Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions from the Molecular to the Proteome Level.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://pubs.acs.org/sharingguidelines</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27074302</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is at the center of molecular biology considering the unquestionable role of proteins in cells. Combinatorial interactions result in a repertoire of multiple functions; hence, knowledge of PPI and binding regions naturally serve to functional proteomics and drug discovery. Given experimental limitations to find all interactions in a proteome, computational prediction/modeling of protein interactions is a prerequisite to proceed on the way to complete interactions at the proteome level. This review aims to provide a background on PPIs and their types. Computational methods for PPI predictions can use a variety of biological data including sequence-, evolution-, expression-, and structure-based data. Physical and statistical modeling are commonly used to integrate these data and infer PPI predictions. We review and list the state-of-the-art methods, servers, databases, and tools for protein-protein interaction prediction.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Albert, István</author><author>Albert, Réka</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conserved network motifs allow protein-protein interaction prediction.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>3346-52</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><accession-num>15247093</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bth402</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2004 - Albert, Albert - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Conserved network motifs allow protein-protein interaction prediction.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.protsuggest.org.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15247093</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION High-throughput protein interaction detection methods are strongly affected by false positive and false negative results. Focused experiments are needed to complement the large-scale methods by validating previously detected interactions but it is often difficult to decide which proteins to probe as interaction partners. Developing reliable computational methods assisting this decision process is a pressing need in bioinformatics. RESULTS We show that we can use the conserved properties of the protein network to identify and validate interaction candidates. We apply a number of machine learning algorithms to the protein connectivity information and achieve a surprisingly good overall performance in predicting interacting proteins. Using a 'leave-one-out' approach we find average success rates between 20 and 40% for predicting the correct interaction partner of a protein. We demonstrate that the success of these methods is based on the presence of conserved interaction motifs within the network.

With a simple assumption that the likelihood of the existence of a link between two nodes can be unfolded by a linear summation of neighboring nodes' contributions, we obtain the analytical solution of the optimal likelihood matrix, which shows remarkably better performance in predicting missing links than the state-of-the-art algorithms for not only simple networks, but also weighted and directed networks. To our surprise, even some degenerated local similarity indices from the solution outperform well-known local indices, which largely refines our knowledge, for example, the direct count of the number of 3-hop paths between two nodes more accurately predicts missing links than the number of 2-hop paths (i.e., the number of common neighbors), while in the previous studies, as indicated by the local path index and Katz index, the statistics on longer paths are always considered to be complementary to but less important than those on shorter paths.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ispolatov, Iaroslav</author><author>Yuryev, Anton</author><author>Mazo, Ilya</author><author>Maslov, Sergei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Binding properties and evolution of homodimers in protein-protein interaction networks.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>3629-35</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15983135</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gki678</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2005 - Ispolatov et al. - Nucleic acids research - Binding properties and evolution of homodimers in protein-protein interaction network.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.ariadnegenomics.com/products/pathway.html</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15983135</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1160523</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We demonstrate that protein-protein interaction networks in several eukaryotic organisms contain significantly more self-interacting proteins than expected if such homodimers randomly appeared in the course of the evolution. We also show that on average homodimers have twice as many interaction partners than non-self-interacting proteins. More specifically, the likelihood of a protein to physically interact with itself was found to be proportional to the total number of its binding partners. These properties of dimers are in agreement with a phenomenological model, in which individual proteins differ from each other by the degree of their 'stickiness' or general propensity toward interaction with other proteins including oneself. A duplication of self-interacting proteins creates a pair of paralogous proteins interacting with each other. We show that such pairs occur more frequently than could be explained by pure chance alone. Similar to homodimers, proteins involved in heterodimers with their paralogs on average have twice as many interacting partners than the rest of the network. The likelihood of a pair of paralogous proteins to interact with each other was also shown to decrease with their sequence similarity. This points to the conclusion that most of interactions between paralogs are inherited from ancestral homodimeric proteins, rather than established de novo after duplication. We finally discuss possible implications of our empirical observations from functional and evolutionary standpoints.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huttlin, Edward L</author><author>Bruckner, Raphael J</author><author>Paulo, Joao A</author><author>Cannon, Joe R</author><author>Ting, Lily</author><author>Baltier, Kurt</author><author>Colby, Greg</author><author>Gebreab, Fana</author><author>Gygi, Melanie P</author><author>Parzen, Hannah</author><author>Szpyt, John</author><author>Tam, Stanley</author><author>Zarraga, Gabriela</author><author>Pontano-Vaites, Laura</author><author>Swarup, Sharan</author><author>White, Anne E</author><author>Schweppe, Devin K</author><author>Rad, Ramin</author><author>Erickson, Brian K</author><author>Obar, Robert A</author><author>Guruharsha, K G</author><author>Li, Kejie</author><author>Artavanis-Tsakonas, Spyros</author><author>Gygi, Steven P</author><author>Harper, J Wade</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>505-509</pages><volume>545</volume><issue>7655</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28514442</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature22366</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Huttlin et al. - Nature - Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22366.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28514442</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5531611</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The physiology of a cell can be viewed as the product of thousands of proteins acting in concert to shape the cellular response. Coordination is achieved in part through networks of protein-protein interactions that assemble functionally related proteins into complexes, organelles, and signal transduction pathways. Understanding the architecture of the human proteome has the potential to inform cellular, structural, and evolutionary mechanisms and is critical to elucidating how genome variation contributes to disease. Here we present BioPlex 2.0 (Biophysical Interactions of ORFeome-derived complexes), which uses robust affinity purification-mass spectrometry methodology to elucidate protein interaction networks and co-complexes nucleated by more than 25% of protein-coding genes from the human genome, and constitutes, to our knowledge, the largest such network so far. With more than 56,000 candidate interactions, BioPlex 2.0 contains more than 29,000 previously unknown co-associations and provides functional insights into hundreds of poorly characterized proteins while enhancing network-based analyses of domain associations, subcellular localization, and co-complex formation. Unsupervised Markov clustering of interacting proteins identified more than 1,300 protein communities representing diverse cellular activities. Genes essential for cell fitness are enriched within 53 communities representing central cellular functions. Moreover, we identified 442 communities associated with more than 2,000 disease annotations, placing numerous candidate disease genes into a cellular framework. BioPlex 2.0 exceeds previous experimentally derived interaction networks in depth and breadth, and will be a valuable resource for exploring the biology of incompletely characterized proteins and for elucidating larger-scale patterns of proteome organization.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanavia, Tiziana</author><author>Aiolli, Fabio</author><author>Da San Martino, Giovanni</author><author>Bisognin, Andrea</author><author>Di Camillo, Barbara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving biomarker list stability by integration of biological knowledge in the learning process.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>S22</pages><volume>13 Suppl 4</volume><issue>SUPPL.4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22536969</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-13-S4-S22</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Sanavia et al. - BMC bioinformatics - Improving biomarker list stability by integration of biological knowledge in the learning p.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/S4/S22</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536969</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3314566</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND The identification of robust lists of molecular biomarkers related to a disease is a fundamental step for early diagnosis and treatment. However, methodologies for biomarker discovery using microarray data often provide results with limited overlap. It has been suggested that one reason for these inconsistencies may be that in complex diseases, such as cancer, multiple genes belonging to one or more physiological pathways are associated with the outcomes. Thus, a possible approach to improve list stability is to integrate biological information from genomic databases in the learning process; however, a comprehensive assessment based on different types of biological information is still lacking in the literature. In this work we have compared the effect of using different biological information in the learning process like functional annotations, protein-protein interactions and expression correlation among genes. RESULTS Biological knowledge has been codified by means of gene similarity matrices and expression data linearly transformed in such a way that the more similar two features are, the more closely they are mapped. Two semantic similarity matrices, based on Biological Process and Molecular Function Gene Ontology annotation, and geodesic distance applied on protein-protein interaction networks, are the best performers in improving list stability maintaining almost equal prediction accuracy. CONCLUSIONS The performed analysis supports the idea that when some features are strongly correlated to each other, for example because are close in the protein-protein interaction network, then they might have similar importance and are equally relevant for the task at hand. Obtained results can be a starting point for additional experiments on combining similarity matrices in order to obtain even more stable lists of biomarkers.

A thorough understanding of cellular organization requires accurate and relatively complete models of interactome networks at proteome scale.

METHODS We conducted an intensive literature search on current or emerging AI and autonomous technologies (eg, vehicles), military and medical technologies (eg, surgical robots), relevant frameworks and standards, cyber security/safety- and legal-systems worldwide. We provide a discussion on unique challenges for robotic surgery faced by proposals made for AI more generally (eg, Explainable AI) and machine learning more specifically (eg, black box), as well as recommendations for developing and improving relevant frameworks or standards. CONCLUSION We classify responsibility into the following: (1) Accountability; (2) Liability; and (3) Culpability. All three aspects were addressed when discussing responsibility for AI and autonomous surgical robots, be these civil or military patients (however, these aspects may require revision in cases where robots become citizens). The component which produces the least clarity is Culpability, since it is unthinkable in the current state of technology. We envision that in the near future a surgical robot can learn and perform routine operative tasks that can then be supervised by a human surgeon. This represents a surgical parallel to autonomously driven vehicles. Here a human remains in the 'driving seat' as a 'doctor-in-the-loop' thereby safeguarding patients undergoing operations that are supported by surgical machines with autonomous capabilities.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Futschik, Matthias E</author><author>Chaurasia, Gautam</author><author>Herzel, Hanspeter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of human protein-protein interaction maps.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>605-11</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17237052</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btl683</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Futschik, Chaurasia, Herzel - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Comparison of human protein-protein interaction maps.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.mdc-berlin.de/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22916002</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3420932</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237052</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION Large-scale mappings of protein-protein interactions have started to give us new views of the complex molecular mechanisms inside a cell. After initial projects to systematically map protein interactions in model organisms such as yeast, worm and fly, researchers have begun to focus on the mapping of the human interactome. To tackle this enormous challenge, different approaches have been proposed and pursued. While several large-scale human protein interaction maps have recently been published, their quality remains to be critically assessed. RESULTS We present here a first comparative analysis of eight currently available large-scale maps with a total of over 10,000 unique proteins and 57,000 interactions included. They are based either on literature search, orthology or by yeast-two-hybrid assays. Comparison reveals only a small, but statistically significant overlap. More importantly, our analysis gives clear indications that all interaction maps imply considerable selection and detection biases. These results have to be taken into account for future assembly of the human interactome.

Unfortunately, even for well-studied species like S. cerevisiae, only a fraction of all true protein interactions are known, which makes it difficult to reason about the exact flow of signals and the corresponding causal relations in the network. To help address this problem, we introduce a framework for predicting new interactions that aid connectivity between upstream proteins (sources) and downstream transcription factors (targets) of a particular pathway. Our algorithms attempt to globally minimize the distance between sources and targets by finding a small set of shortcut edges to add to the network. Unlike existing algorithms for predicting general protein interactions, by focusing on proteins involved in specific responses our approach homes-in on pathway-consistent interactions. We applied our method to extend pathways in osmotic stress response in yeast and identified several missing interactions, some of which are supported by published reports. We also performed experiments that support a novel interaction not previously reported. Our framework is general and may be applicable to edge prediction problems in other domains.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kovács, István A</author><author>Luck, Katja</author><author>Spirohn, Kerstin</author><author>Wang, Yang</author><author>Pollis, Carl</author><author>Schlabach, Sadie</author><author>Bian, Wenting</author><author>Kim, Dae-Kyum</author><author>Kishore, Nishka</author><author>Hao, Tong</author><author>Calderwood, Michael A</author><author>Vidal, Marc</author><author>Barabási, Albert-László</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Network-based prediction of protein interactions.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1240</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>4146701909177</isbn><accession-num>30886144</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-019-09177-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Kovács et al. - Nature communications - Network-based prediction of protein interactions.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09177-y</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886144</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6423278</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Despite exceptional experimental efforts to map out the human interactome, the continued data incompleteness limits our ability to understand the molecular roots of human disease. Computational tools offer a promising alternative, helping identify biologically significant, yet unmapped protein-protein interactions (PPIs). While link prediction methods connect proteins on the basis of biological or network-based similarity, interacting proteins are not necessarily similar and similar proteins do not necessarily interact. Here, we offer structural and evolutionary evidence that proteins interact not if they are similar to each other, but if one of them is similar to the other's partners. This approach, that mathematically relies on network paths of length three (L3), significantly outperforms all existing link prediction methods. Given its high accuracy, we show that L3 can offer mechanistic insights into disease mechanisms and can complement future experimental efforts to complete the human interactome.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guimerà, Roger</author><author>Sales-Pardo, Marta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Missing and spurious interactions and the reconstruction of complex networks.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>22073-8</pages><volume>106</volume><issue>52</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>20018705</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.0908366106</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Guimerà, Sales-Pardo - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Missing and spurious in.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20018705</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2799723</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Network analysis is currently used in a myriad of contexts, from identifying potential drug targets to predicting the spread of epidemics and designing vaccination strategies and from finding friends to uncovering criminal activity.

Here, we present a general mathematical and computational framework to deal with the problem of data reliability in complex networks. In particular, we are able to reliably identify both missing and spurious interactions in noisy network observations. Remarkably, our approach also enables us to obtain, from those noisy observations, network reconstructions that yield estimates of the true network properties that are more accurate than those provided by the observations themselves.

It is still moot as to whether AI will replace radiologists in day-to-day clinical practice, but more AI applications are expected to be incorporated into the workflows in the foreseeable future. These applications could produce significant ethical and legal issues in healthcare if they cause abrupt disruptions to its contextual integrity and relational dynamics. Sustaining trust and trustworthiness is a key goal of governance, which is necessary to promote collaboration among all stakeholders and to ensure the responsible development and implementation of AI in radiology and other areas of clinical work. In this paper, the nature of AI governance in biomedicine is discussed along with its limitations. It is argued that radiologists must assume a more active role in propelling medicine into the digital age. In this respect, professional responsibilities include inquiring into the clinical and social value of AI, alleviating deficiencies in technical knowledge in order to facilitate ethical evaluation, supporting the recognition, and removal of biases, engaging the &quot;black box&quot; obstacle, and brokering a new social contract on informational use and security. In essence, a much closer integration of ethics, laws, and good practices is needed to ensure that AI governance achieves its normative goals.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiménez, Jose Ignacio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Shedding light on the black box models of the cell.</title><secondary-title>Microbial biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microbial biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>43-45</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28044423</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1751-7915.12489</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Jiménez - Microbial biotechnology - Shedding light on the black box models of the cell.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5270715/pdf/MBT2-10-43.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28044423</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5270715</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huminiecki, Lukasz</author><author>Lloyd, Andrew T</author><author>Wolfe, Kenneth H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Congruence of tissue expression profiles from Gene Expression Atlas, SAGEmap and TissueInfo databases.</title><secondary-title>BMC genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC genomics</full-title></periodical><pages>31</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><accession-num>12885301</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2164-4-31</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2003 - Huminiecki, Lloyd, Wolfe - BMC genomics - Congruence of tissue expression profiles from Gene Expression Atlas, SAGEmap and Tissue.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/31</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12885301</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC183867</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Extracting biological knowledge from large amounts of gene expression information deposited in public databases is a major challenge of the postgenomic era. Additional insights may be derived by data integration and cross-platform comparisons of expression profiles. However, database meta-analysis is complicated by differences in experimental technologies, data post-processing, database formats, and inconsistent gene and sample annotation. RESULTS We have analysed expression profiles from three public databases: Gene Expression Atlas, SAGEmap and TissueInfo. These are repositories of oligonucleotide microarray, Serial Analysis of Gene Expression and Expressed Sequence Tag human gene expression data respectively. We devised a method, Preferential Expression Measure, to identify genes that are significantly over- or under-expressed in any given tissue. We examined intra- and inter-database consistency of Preferential Expression Measures. There was good correlation between replicate experiments of oligonucleotide microarray data, but there was less coherence in expression profiles as measured by Serial Analysis of Gene Expression and Expressed Sequence Tag counts. We investigated inter-database correlations for six tissue categories, for which data were present in the three databases. Significant positive correlations were found for brain, prostate and vascular endothelium but not for ovary, kidney, and pancreas. CONCLUSION We show that data from Gene Expression Atlas, SAGEmap and TissueInfo can be integrated using the UniGene gene index, and that expression profiles correlate relatively well when large numbers of tags are available or when tissue cellular composition is simple. Finally, in the case of brain, we demonstrate that when PEM values show good correlation, predictions of tissue-specific expression based on integrated data are very accurate.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kawada, Kenji</author><author>Toda, Kosuke</author><author>Sakai, Yoshiharu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Targeting metabolic reprogramming in KRAS-driven cancers.</title><secondary-title>International journal of clinical oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of clinical oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>651-659</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer metabolism</keyword><keyword>Glutaminolysis</keyword><keyword>Glycolysis</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>Reprograming</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28647837</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10147-017-1156-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Kawada, Toda, Sakai - International journal of clinical oncology - Targeting metabolic reprogramming in KRAS-driven cancers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10147-017-1156-4.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28647837</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mutations of KRAS are found in a variety of human malignancies, including in pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer at high frequency. To date, no effective treatments that target mutant variants of KRAS have been introduced into clinical practice. In recent years, a number of studies have shown that the oncogene KRAS plays a critical role in controlling cancer metabolism by orchestrating multiple metabolic changes. One of the metabolic hallmarks of malignant tumor cells is their dependency on aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect. The role of KRAS signaling in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis has been reported in several types of cancer. KRAS-driven cancers are characterized by altered metabolic pathways involving enhanced nutrients uptake, enhanced glycolysis, enhanced glutaminolysis, and elevated synthesis of fatty acids and nucleotides. However, Just how mutated KRAS can coordinate the metabolic shift to promote tumor growth and whether specific metabolic pathways are essential for the tumorigenesis of KRAS-driven cancers are questions which remain to be answered. In this context, the aim of this review is to summarize current data on KRAS-related metabolic alterations in cancer cells. Given that cancer cells rely on changes in metabolism to support their growth and survival, the targeting of metabolic processes may be a potential strategy for treating KRAS-driven cancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ying, Haoqiang</author><author>Kimmelman, Alec C</author><author>Lyssiotis, Costas A</author><author>Hua, Sujun</author><author>Chu, Gerald C</author><author>Fletcher-Sananikone, Eliot</author><author>Locasale, Jason W</author><author>Son, Jaekyoung</author><author>Zhang, Hailei</author><author>Coloff, Jonathan L</author><author>Yan, Haiyan</author><author>Wang, Wei</author><author>Chen, Shujuan</author><author>Viale, Andrea</author><author>Zheng, Hongwu</author><author>Paik, Ji-hye</author><author>Lim, Carol</author><author>Guimaraes, Alexander R</author><author>Martin, Eric S</author><author>Chang, Jeffery</author><author>Hezel, Aram F</author><author>Perry, Samuel R</author><author>Hu, Jian</author><author>Gan, Boyi</author><author>Xiao, Yonghong</author><author>Asara, John M</author><author>Weissleder, Ralph</author><author>Wang, Y Alan</author><author>Chin, Lynda</author><author>Cantley, Lewis C</author><author>DePinho, Ronald A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oncogenic Kras maintains pancreatic tumors through regulation of anabolic glucose metabolism.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>656-70</pages><volume>149</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22541435</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2012.01.058</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Ying et al. - Cell - Oncogenic Kras maintains pancreatic tumors through regulation of anabolic glucose metabolism.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2812%2900352-2</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22541435</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3472002</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Tumor maintenance relies on continued activity of driver oncogenes, although their rate-limiting role is highly context dependent. Oncogenic Kras mutation is the signature event in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), serving a critical role in tumor initiation. Here, an inducible Kras(G12D)-driven PDAC mouse model establishes that advanced PDAC remains strictly dependent on Kras(G12D) expression. Transcriptome and metabolomic analyses indicate that Kras(G12D) serves a vital role in controlling tumor metabolism through stimulation of glucose uptake and channeling of glucose intermediates into the hexosamine biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathways (PPP). These studies also reveal that oncogenic Kras promotes ribose biogenesis. Unlike canonical models, we demonstrate that Kras(G12D) drives glycolysis intermediates into the nonoxidative PPP, thereby decoupling ribose biogenesis from NADP/NADPH-mediated redox control. Together, this work provides in vivo mechanistic insights into how oncogenic Kras promotes metabolic reprogramming in native tumors and illuminates potential metabolic targets that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit in PDAC.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Meng</author><author>Chaurushiya, Mira S</author><author>Webster, Joshua D</author><author>Kummerfeld, Sarah</author><author>Reja, Rohit</author><author>Chaudhuri, Subhra</author><author>Chen, Ying-Jiun</author><author>Modrusan, Zora</author><author>Haley, Benjamin</author><author>Dugger, Debra L</author><author>Eastham-Anderson, Jeffrey</author><author>Lau, Shari</author><author>Dey, Anwesha</author><author>Caothien, Roger</author><author>Roose-Girma, Merone</author><author>Newton, Kim</author><author>Dixit, Vishva M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intrinsic apoptosis shapes the tumor spectrum linked to inactivation of the deubiquitinase BAP1.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>283-285</pages><volume>364</volume><issue>6437</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>1127211277</isbn><accession-num>31000662</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.aav4902</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - He et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Intrinsic apoptosis shapes the tumor spectrum linked to inactivation of the deubiquitinase.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31000662</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Malignancies arising from mutation of tumor suppressors have unexplained tissue proclivity. For example, BAP1 encodes a widely expressed deubiquitinase for histone H2A, but germline mutations are predominantly associated with uveal melanomas and mesotheliomas. We show that BAP1 inactivation causes apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells, fibroblasts, liver, and pancreatic tissue but not in melanocytes and mesothelial cells. Ubiquitin ligase RNF2, which silences genes by monoubiquitinating H2A, promoted apoptosis in BAP1-deficient cells by suppressing expression of the prosurvival genes Bcl2 and Mcl1. In contrast, BAP1 loss in melanocytes had little impact on expression of prosurvival genes, instead inducing Mitf Thus, BAP1 appears to modulate gene expression by countering H2A ubiquitination, but its loss only promotes tumorigenesis in cells that do not engage an RNF2-dependent apoptotic program.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Zixing</author><author>Ng, Kwok-Shing</author><author>Chen, Tenghui</author><author>Kim, Tae-Beom</author><author>Wang, Fang</author><author>Shaw, Kenna</author><author>Scott, Kenneth L</author><author>Meric-Bernstam, Funda</author><author>Mills, Gordon B</author><author>Chen, Ken</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cancer driver mutation prediction through Bayesian integration of multi-omic data.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0196939</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>29738578</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0196939</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Wang et al. - PloS one - Cancer driver mutation prediction through Bayesian integration of multi-omic data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196939.g001</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29738578</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5940219</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Identification of cancer driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. Here, we show that a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, named rDriver can achieve enhanced prediction accuracy by identifying mutations that not only have high functional impact scores but also are associated with systemic variation in gene expression levels. In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival. Evaluation of rDriver predictions using engineered cell-line models resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.94 in PIK3CA genes. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tiong, Khong-Loon</author><author>Yeang, Chen-Hsiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Explaining cancer type specific mutations with transcriptomic and epigenomic features in normal tissues.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title></periodical><pages>11456</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30061703</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-018-29861-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Tiong, Yeang - Scientific reports - Explaining cancer type specific mutations with transcriptomic and epigenomic features in norm.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/scientificreports/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061703</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6065413</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Most cancer driver genes are involved in generic cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell proliferation and cell adhesion, yet their mutations are often confined to specific cancer types. To resolve this paradox, we explained mutation frequencies of selected genes across tumor types with four features in the corresponding normal tissues from cancer-free subjects: mRNA expression and chromatin accessibility of mutated genes, mRNA expressions of their neighbors in curated pathways and the protein-protein interaction network. Encouragingly, these transcriptomic/epigenomic features in normal tissues were closely associated with mutational/functional characteristics in tumors. First, chromatin accessibility was a necessary but not sufficient condition for frequent mutations. Second, variations of mutation frequencies in selected genes across tissue types were significantly associated with all four features. Third, the genes possessing significant associations between mutation frequency variations and pathway gene expression were enriched with documented cancer genes. We further proposed a novel bivariate gene set enrichment analysis and confirmed that the pathway gene expression was the dominant factor in cancer gene enrichment. These findings shed lights on the functional roles of genes in normal tissues in shaping the mutational landscape during tumor genome evolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Junhua</author><author>Zhang, Shihua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Discovery of cancer common and specific driver gene sets.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>e86</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28168295</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkx089</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Zhang, Zhang - Nucleic acids research - Discovery of cancer common and specific driver gene sets.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5449640/pdf/gkx089.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28168295</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5449640</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancer is known as a disease mainly caused by gene alterations. Discovery of mutated driver pathways or gene sets is becoming an important step to understand molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. However, systematically investigating commonalities and specificities of driver gene sets among multiple cancer types is still a great challenge, but this investigation will undoubtedly benefit deciphering cancers and will be helpful for personalized therapy and precision medicine in cancer treatment. In this study, we propose two optimization models to de novo discover common driver gene sets among multiple cancer types (ComMDP) and specific driver gene sets of one certain or multiple cancer types to other cancers (SpeMDP), respectively. We first apply ComMDP and SpeMDP to simulated data to validate their efficiency. Then, we further apply these methods to 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and obtain several biologically meaningful driver pathways. As examples, we construct a common cancer pathway model for BRCA and OV, infer a complex driver pathway model for BRCA carcinogenesis based on common driver gene sets of BRCA with eight cancer types, and investigate specific driver pathways of the liquid cancer lymphoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) versus other solid cancer types. In these processes more candidate cancer genes are also found.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiao, Sheng-Jian</author><author>Zhang, Chi</author><author>Zou, Quan</author><author>Ji, Zhi-Liang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TiSGeD: a database for tissue-specific genes.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>1273-5</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>26/9/1273/199782</isbn><accession-num>20223836</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btq109</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Xiao et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - TiSGeD a database for tissue-specific genes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://watermark.silverchair.com/btq109.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlowggJWBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJHMIICQwIBADCCAjwGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMNbI_I6GPUcy77JiCAgEQgIICDRw_949tngeuWOi_itrganR6TvayPgO81U-T2kdkFyftVIJh</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>UNLABELLED The tissue-specific genes are a group of genes whose function and expression are preferred in one or several tissues/cell types.

Here we present a study of the structural patterns in promoters of genes expressed specifically in 26 human and 34 mouse tissues. For each tissue we constructed promoter structure models, taking into account presences of motifs, their positioning to the transcription start site, and pairwise positioning of motifs. We found that 35 out of 60 models (58%) were able to distinguish positive test promoter sequences from control promoter sequences with statistical significance. Models with high performance include those for liver, skeletal muscle, kidney and tongue. Many of the important structural patterns in these models involve transcription factors of known importance in the tissues in question and structural patterns tend to be conserved between human and mouse. In addition to that, promoter models for related tissues tend to have high inter-tissue performance, indicating that their promoters share common structural patterns. Together, these results illustrate the validity of our models, but also indicate that the promoter structures for some tissues are easier to model than those of others.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Julien, Philippe</author><author>Brawand, David</author><author>Soumillon, Magali</author><author>Necsulea, Anamaria</author><author>Liechti, Angélica</author><author>Schütz, Frédéric</author><author>Daish, Tasman</author><author>Grützner, Frank</author><author>Kaessmann, Henrik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms and evolutionary patterns of mammalian and avian dosage compensation.</title><secondary-title>PLoS biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1001328</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22615540</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pbio.1001328</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Julien et al. - PLoS biology - Mechanisms and evolutionary patterns of mammalian and avian dosage compensation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.plosbiology.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22615540</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3352821</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As a result of sex chromosome differentiation from ancestral autosomes, male mammalian cells only contain one X chromosome. It has long been hypothesized that X-linked gene expression levels have become doubled in males to restore the original transcriptional output, and that the resulting X overexpression in females then drove the evolution of X inactivation (XCI). However, this model has never been directly tested and patterns and mechanisms of dosage compensation across different mammals and birds generally remain little understood. Here we trace the evolution of dosage compensation using extensive transcriptome data from males and females representing all major mammalian lineages and birds. Our analyses suggest that the X has become globally upregulated in marsupials, whereas we do not detect a global upregulation of this chromosome in placental mammals. However, we find that a subset of autosomal genes interacting with X-linked genes have become downregulated in placentals upon the emergence of sex chromosomes. Thus, different driving forces may underlie the evolution of XCI and the highly efficient equilibration of X expression levels between the sexes observed for both of these lineages. In the egg-laying monotremes and birds, which have partially homologous sex chromosome systems, partial upregulation of the X (Z in birds) evolved but is largely restricted to the heterogametic sex, which provides an explanation for the partially sex-biased X (Z) expression and lack of global inactivation mechanisms in these lineages. Our findings suggest that dosage reductions imposed by sex chromosome differentiation events in amniotes were resolved in strikingly different ways.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, Xueping</author><author>Lin, Jimmy</author><author>Zack, Donald J</author><author>Qian, Jiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computational analysis of tissue-specific combinatorial gene regulation: predicting interaction between transcription factors in human tissues.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>4925-36</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16982645</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkl595</electronic-resource-num><notes>creation of EE for gene expression tissue specificity</notes><research-notes>creation of EE for gene expression tissue specificity</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2006 - Yu et al. - Nucleic acids research - Computational analysis of tissue-specific combinatorial gene regulation predicting interacti.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/34/17/4925/3111971</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16982645</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1635265</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Tissue-specific gene expression is generally regulated by more than a single transcription factor (TF). Multiple TFs work in concert to achieve tissue specificity. In order to explore these complex TF interaction networks, we performed a large-scale analysis of TF interactions for 30 human tissues. We first identified tissue-specific genes for 30 tissues based on gene expression databases. We then evaluated the relationships between TFs using the relative position and co-occurrence of their binding sites in the promoters of tissue-specific genes. The predicted TF-TF interactions were validated by both known protein-protein interactions and co-expression of their target genes. We found that our predictions are enriched in known protein-protein interactions (&gt;80 times that of random expectation). In addition, we found that the target genes show the highest co-expression in the tissue of interest. Our findings demonstrate that non-tissue specific TFs play a large role in regulation of tissue-specific genes. Furthermore, they show that individual TFs can contribute to tissue specificity in different tissues by interacting with distinct TF partners. Lastly, we identified several tissue-specific TF clusters that may play important roles in tissue-specific gene regulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dezso, Zoltán</author><author>Nikolsky, Yuri</author><author>Sviridov, Evgeny</author><author>Shi, Weiwei</author><author>Serebriyskaya, Tatiana</author><author>Dosymbekov, Damir</author><author>Bugrim, Andrej</author><author>Rakhmatulin, Eugene</author><author>Brennan, Richard J</author><author>Guryanov, Alexey</author><author>Li, Kelly</author><author>Blake, Julie</author><author>Samaha, Raymond R</author><author>Nikolskaya, Tatiana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comprehensive functional analysis of tissue specificity of human gene expression.</title><secondary-title>BMC biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC biology</full-title></periodical><pages>49</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>19014478</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1741-7007-6-49</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2008 - Dezso et al. - BMC biology - A comprehensive functional analysis of tissue specificity of human gene expression.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/49</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19014478</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2645369</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND In recent years, the maturation of microarray technology has allowed the genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns to identify tissue-specific and ubiquitously expressed ('housekeeping') genes. We have performed a functional and topological analysis of housekeeping and tissue-specific networks to identify universally necessary biological processes, and those unique to or characteristic of particular tissues. RESULTS We measured whole genome expression in 31 human tissues, identifying 2374 housekeeping genes expressed in all tissues, and genes uniquely expressed in each tissue. Comprehensive functional analysis showed that the housekeeping set is substantially larger than previously thought, and is enriched with vital processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, translation and energy metabolism. Network topology of the housekeeping network was characterized by higher connectivity and shorter paths between the proteins than the global network. Ontology enrichment scoring and network topology of tissue-specific genes were consistent with each tissue's function and expression patterns clustered together in accordance with tissue origin. Tissue-specific genes were twice as likely as housekeeping genes to be drug targets, allowing the identification of tissue 'signature networks' that will facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic targets and biomarkers of tissue-targeted diseases. CONCLUSION A comprehensive functional analysis of housekeeping and tissue-specific genes showed that the biological function of housekeeping and tissue-specific genes was consistent with tissue origin. Network analysis revealed that tissue-specific networks have distinct network properties related to each tissue's function. Tissue 'signature networks' promise to be a rich source of targets and biomarkers for disease treatment and diagnosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yanai, Itai</author><author>Benjamin, Hila</author><author>Shmoish, Michael</author><author>Chalifa-Caspi, Vered</author><author>Shklar, Maxim</author><author>Ophir, Ron</author><author>Bar-Even, Arren</author><author>Horn-Saban, Shirley</author><author>Safran, Marilyn</author><author>Domany, Eytan</author><author>Lancet, Doron</author><author>Shmueli, Orit</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide midrange transcription profiles reveal expression level relationships in human tissue specification.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>650-9</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15388519</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bti042</electronic-resource-num><notes>creation of Tau specificity index for gene expression</notes><research-notes>creation of Tau specificity index for gene expression</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2005 - Yanai et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Genome-wide midrange transcription profiles reveal expression level relationshi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/21/5/650/220059</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15388519</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION Genes are often characterized dichotomously as either housekeeping or single-tissue specific. We conjectured that crucial functional information resides in genes with midrange profiles of expression. RESULTS To obtain such novel information genome-wide, we have determined the mRNA expression levels for one of the largest hitherto analyzed set of 62 839 probesets in 12 representative normal human tissues. Indeed, when using a newly defined graded tissue specificity index tau, valued between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for tissue-specific genes, genes with midrange profiles having 0.15&lt; tau&lt;0.85 were found to constitute &gt;50% of all expression patterns. We developed a binary classification, indicating for every gene the I(B) tissues in which it is overly expressed, and the 12-I(B) tissues in which it shows low expression. The 85 dominant midrange patterns with I(B)=2-11 were found to be bimodally distributed, and to contribute most significantly to the definition of tissue specification dendrograms. Our analyses provide a novel route to infer expression profiles for presumed ancestral nodes in the tissue dendrogram. Such definition has uncovered an unsuspected correlation, whereby de novo enhancement and diminution of gene expression go hand in hand.

Both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes occupy similar ranges of GC content, but the former tend to concentrate in the upper part of the range. In the human genome, tissue-specific genes show two maxima, GC-poor and GC-rich. The strictly tissue-specific human genes tend to concentrate in the GC-poor region; their distribution is left-skewed and thus reciprocal to the distribution of housekeeping genes. The intermediately tissue-specific genes show an intermediate GC content and the right-skewed distribution. Both in the human and mouse, genes specific for some tissues (e.g., parts of the central nervous system) have a higher average GC content than housekeeping genes. Since they are not transcribed in the germ line (in contrast to housekeeping genes), and therefore have a lower probability of inheritable gene conversion, this finding contradicts the biased gene conversion (BGC) explanation for elevated GC content in the heavy isochores of mammal genome. Genes specific for germ-line tissues (ovary, testes) show a low average GC content, which is also in contradiction to the BGC explanation. Both for the total data set and for the most part of tissues taken separately, a weak positive correlation was found between gene GC content and expression level. The fraction of ubiquitously expressed genes is nearly 1.5-fold higher in the mouse than in the human. This suggests that mouse tissues are comparatively less differentiated (on the molecular level), which can be related to a less pronounced isochoric structure of the mouse genome. In each separate tissue (in both species), tissue-specific genes do not form a clear-cut frequency peak (in contrast to housekeeping genes), but constitute a continuum with a gradually increasing degree of tissue-specificity, which probably reflects the path of cell differentiation and/or an independent use of the same protein in several unrelated tissues.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schug, Jonathan</author><author>Schuller, Winfried-Paul</author><author>Kappen, Claudia</author><author>Salbaum, J Michael</author><author>Bucan, Maja</author><author>Stoeckert, Christian J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Promoter features related to tissue specificity as measured by Shannon entropy.</title><secondary-title>Genome biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome biology</full-title></periodical><pages>R33</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15833120</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/gb-2005-6-4-r33</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2005 - Schug et al. - Genome biology - Promoter features related to tissue specificity as measured by Shannon entropy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15833120</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1088961</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND The regulatory mechanisms underlying tissue specificity are a crucial part of the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms. A genome-wide analysis of promoters in the context of gene-expression patterns in tissue surveys provides a means of identifying the general principles for these mechanisms. RESULTS We introduce a definition of tissue specificity based on Shannon entropy to rank human genes according to their overall tissue specificity and by their specificity to particular tissues. We apply our definition to microarray-based and expressed sequence tag (EST)-based expression data for human genes and use similar data for mouse genes to validate our results. We show that most genes show statistically significant tissue-dependent variations in expression level. We find that the most tissue-specific genes typically have a TATA box, no CpG island, and often code for extracellular proteins. As expected, CpG islands are found in most of the least tissue-specific genes, which often code for proteins located in the nucleus or mitochondrion. The class of genes with no CpG island or TATA box are the most common mid-specificity genes and commonly code for proteins located in a membrane. Sp1 was found to be a weak indicator of less-specific expression. YY1 binding sites, either as initiators or as downstream sites, were strongly associated with the least-specific genes. CONCLUSIONS We have begun to understand the components of promoters that distinguish tissue-specific from ubiquitous genes, to identify associations that can predict the broad class of gene expression from sequence data alone.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Xiaoxiao</author><author>Wells, Alan B</author><author>O'Brien, David R.</author><author>Nehorai, Arye</author><author>Dougherty, Joseph D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell type-specific expression analysis to identify putative cellular mechanisms for neurogenetic disorders.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>1420-31</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>448813.2014</isbn><accession-num>24453331</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4488-13.2014</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Xu et al. - The Journal of neuroscience the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience - Cell type-specific expression ana.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/34/4/1420.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453331</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3898298</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Recent advances have substantially increased the number of genes that are statistically associated with complex genetic disorders of the CNS such as autism and schizophrenia. It is now clear that there will likely be hundreds of distinct loci contributing to these disorders, underscoring a remarkable genetic heterogeneity. It is unclear whether this genetic heterogeneity indicates an equal heterogeneity of cellular mechanisms for these diseases. The commonality of symptoms across patients suggests there could be a functional convergence downstream of these loci upon a limited number of cell types or circuits that mediate the affected behaviors. One possible mechanism for this convergence would be the selective expression of at least a subset of these genes in the cell types that comprise these circuits. Using profiling data from mice and humans, we have developed and validated an approach, cell type-specific expression analysis, for identifying candidate cell populations likely to be disrupted across sets of patients with distinct genetic lesions. Using human genetics data and postmortem gene expression data, our approach can correctly identify the cell types for disorders of known cellular etiology, including narcolepsy and retinopathies. Applying this approach to autism, a disease where the cellular mechanism is unclear, indicates there may be multiple cellular routes to this disorder. Our approach may be useful for identifying common cellular mechanisms arising from distinct genetic lesions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dougherty, Joseph D</author><author>Schmidt, Eric F</author><author>Nakajima, Miho</author><author>Heintz, Nathaniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analytical approaches to RNA profiling data for the identification of genes enriched in specific cells.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>4218-30</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>2123277878</isbn><accession-num>20308160</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkq130</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Dougherty et al. - Nucleic acids research - Analytical approaches to RNA profiling data for the identification of genes enriched.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.bactrap.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308160</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2910036</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We have recently developed a novel method for the affinity purification of the complete suite of translating mRNA from genetically labeled cell populations. This method permits comprehensive quantitative comparisons of the genes employed by each specific cell type. We provide a detailed description of tools for analysis of data generated with this and related methodologies. An essential question that arises from these data is how to identify those genes that are enriched in each cell type relative to all others. Genes relatively specifically employed by a cell type may contribute to the unique functions of that cell, and thus may become useful targets for development of pharmacological tools for cell-specific manipulations. We describe here a novel statistic, the specificity index, which can be used for comparative quantitative analysis to identify genes enriched in specific cell populations across a large number of profiles. This measure correctly predicts in situ hybridization patterns for many cell types. We apply this measure to a large survey of CNS cell-specific microarray data to identify those genes that are significantly enriched in each population Data and algorithms are available online (www.bactrap.org).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kryuchkova-Mostacci, Nadezda</author><author>Robinson-Rechavi, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tissue-Specificity of Gene Expression Diverges Slowly between Orthologs, and Rapidly between Paralogs.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1005274</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>28030541</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005274</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Kryuchkova-Mostacci, Robinson-Rechavi - PLoS computational biology - Tissue-Specificity of Gene Expression Diverges Slowly betwee.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005274&amp;type=printable</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28030541</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5193323</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The ortholog conjecture implies that functional similarity between orthologous genes is higher than between paralogs. It has been supported using levels of expression and Gene Ontology term analysis, although the evidence was rather weak and there were also conflicting reports. In this study on 12 species we provide strong evidence of high conservation in tissue-specificity between orthologs, in contrast to low conservation between within-species paralogs. This allows us to shed a new light on the evolution of gene expression patterns. While there have been several studies of the correlation of expression between species, little is known about the evolution of tissue-specificity itself. Ortholog tissue-specificity is strongly conserved between all tetrapod species, with the lowest Pearson correlation between mouse and frog at r = 0.66. Tissue-specificity correlation decreases strongly with divergence time. Paralogs in human show much lower conservation, even for recent Primate-specific paralogs. When both paralogs from ancient whole genome duplication tissue-specific paralogs are tissue-specific, it is often to different tissues, while other tissue-specific paralogs are mostly specific to the same tissue. The same patterns are observed using human or mouse as focal species, and are robust to choices of datasets and of thresholds. Our results support the following model of evolution: in the absence of duplication, tissue-specificity evolves slowly, and tissue-specific genes do not change their main tissue of expression; after small-scale duplication the less expressed paralog loses the ancestral specificity, leading to an immediate difference between paralogs; over time, both paralogs become more broadly expressed, but remain poorly correlated. Finally, there is a small number of paralog pairs which stay tissue-specific with the same main tissue of expression, for at least 300 million years.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kryuchkova-Mostacci, Nadezda</author><author>Robinson-Rechavi, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A benchmark of gene expression tissue-specificity metrics.</title><secondary-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>205-214</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>RNA-seq</keyword><keyword>expression</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>microarray</keyword><keyword>mouse</keyword><keyword>tissue specificity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>26891983</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bib/bbw008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Kryuchkova-Mostacci, Robinson-Rechavi - Briefings in bioinformatics - A benchmark of gene expression tissue-specificity metrics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-abstract/18/2/205/2562739</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891983</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5444245</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>One of the major properties of genes is their expression pattern. Notably, genes are often classified as tissue specific or housekeeping. This property is of interest to molecular evolution as an explanatory factor of, e.g. evolutionary rate, as well as a functional feature which may in itself evolve. While many different methods of measuring tissue specificity have been proposed and used for such studies, there has been no comparison or benchmarking of these methods to our knowledge, and little justification of their use. In this study, we compare nine measures of tissue specificity. Most methods were established for ESTs and microarrays, and several were later adapted to RNA-seq. We analyse their capacity to distinguish gene categories, their robustness to the choice and number of tissues used and their capture of evolutionary conservation signal.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laprell, Friederike</author><author>Finkl, Katja</author><author>Müller, Jürg</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Propagation of Polycomb-repressed chromatin requires sequence-specific recruitment to DNA.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>85-88</pages><volume>356</volume><issue>6333</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28302792</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.aai8266</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Laprell, Finkl, Müller - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Propagation of Polycomb-repressed chromatin requires sequence-specific recru.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28302792</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Epigenetic inheritance models posit that during Polycomb repression, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) propagates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) independently of DNA sequence. We show that insertion of Polycomb response element (PRE) DNA into the Drosophila genome creates extended domains of H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes in the flanking chromatin and causes repression of a linked reporter gene. After excision of PRE DNA, H3K27me3 nucleosomes become diluted with each round of DNA replication, and reporter gene repression is lost. After excision in replication-stalled cells, H3K27me3 levels stay high and repression persists. H3K27me3-marked nucleosomes therefore provide a memory of repression that is transmitted in a sequence-independent manner to daughter strand DNA during replication. In contrast, propagation of H3K27 trimethylation to newly incorporated nucleosomes requires sequence-specific targeting of PRC2 to PRE DNA.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ku, Manching</author><author>Koche, Richard P</author><author>Rheinbay, Esther</author><author>Mendenhall, Eric M</author><author>Endoh, Mitsuhiro</author><author>Mikkelsen, Tarjei S.</author><author>Presser, Aviva</author><author>Nusbaum, Chad</author><author>Xie, Xiaohui</author><author>Chi, Andrew S.</author><author>Adli, Mazhar</author><author>Kasif, Simon</author><author>Ptaszek, Leon M.</author><author>Cowan, Chad A.</author><author>Lander, Eric S.</author><author>Koseki, Haruhiko</author><author>Bernstein, Bradley E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomewide analysis of PRC1 and PRC2 occupancy identifies two classes of bivalent domains.</title><secondary-title>PLoS genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>e1000242</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><accession-num>18974828</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1000242</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2008 - Ku et al. - PLoS genetics - Genomewide analysis of PRC1 and PRC2 occupancy identifies two classes of bivalent domains.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.broad.mit.edu/seq_platform/chip/.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974828</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2567431</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In embryonic stem (ES) cells, bivalent chromatin domains with overlapping repressive (H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation) and activating (H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation) histone modifications mark the promoters of more than 2,000 genes. To gain insight into the structure and function of bivalent domains, we mapped key histone modifications and subunits of Polycomb-repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) genomewide in human and mouse ES cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by ultra high-throughput sequencing. We find that bivalent domains can be segregated into two classes -- the first occupied by both PRC2 and PRC1 (PRC1-positive) and the second specifically bound by PRC2 (PRC2-only). PRC1-positive bivalent domains appear functionally distinct as they more efficiently retain lysine 27 tri-methylation upon differentiation, show stringent conservation of chromatin state, and associate with an overwhelming number of developmental regulator gene promoters. We also used computational genomics to search for sequence determinants of Polycomb binding. This analysis revealed that the genomewide locations of PRC2 and PRC1 can be largely predicted from the locations, sizes, and underlying motif contents of CpG islands. We propose that large CpG islands depleted of activating motifs confer epigenetic memory by recruiting the full repertoire of Polycomb complexes in pluripotent cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Justin, Neil</author><author>Zhang, Ying</author><author>Tarricone, Cataldo</author><author>Martin, Stephen R</author><author>Chen, Shuyang</author><author>Underwood, Elizabeth</author><author>De Marco, Valeria</author><author>Haire, Lesley F</author><author>Walker, Philip A</author><author>Reinberg, Danny</author><author>Wilson, Jon R</author><author>Gamblin, Steven J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structural basis of oncogenic histone H3K27M inhibition of human polycomb repressive complex 2.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>11316</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27121947</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms11316</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Justin et al. - Nature communications - Structural basis of oncogenic histone H3K27M inhibition of human polycomb repressive comp.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/naturecommunications</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27121947</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4853476</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) silences gene expression through trimethylation of K27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) via its catalytic SET domain. A missense mutation in the substrate of PRC2, histone H3K27M, is associated with certain pediatric brain cancers and is linked to a global decrease of H3K27me3 in the affected cells thought to be mediated by inhibition of PRC2 activity. We present here the crystal structure of human PRC2 in complex with the inhibitory H3K27M peptide bound to the active site of the SET domain, with the methionine residue located in the pocket that normally accommodates the target lysine residue. The structure and binding studies suggest a mechanism for the oncogenic inhibition of H3K27M. The structure also reveals how binding of repressive marks, like H3K27me3, to the EED subunit of the complex leads to enhancement of the catalytic efficiency of the SET domain and thus the propagation of this repressive histone modification.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fulco, Charles P</author><author>Munschauer, Mathias</author><author>Anyoha, Rockwell</author><author>Munson, Glen</author><author>Grossman, Sharon R</author><author>Perez, Elizabeth M</author><author>Kane, Michael</author><author>Cleary, Brian</author><author>Lander, Eric S</author><author>Engreitz, Jesse M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systematic mapping of functional enhancer-promoter connections with CRISPR interference.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>769-773</pages><volume>354</volume><issue>6313</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27708057</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.aag2445</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Fulco et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Systematic mapping of functional enhancer-promoter connections with CRISPR interference.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27708057</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5438575</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Gene expression in mammals is regulated by noncoding elements that can affect physiology and disease, yet the functions and target genes of most noncoding elements remain unknown.

A simple equation based on a mechanistic model for enhancer function performed remarkably well at predicting the complex patterns of regulatory connections we observe in our CRISPR dataset.

Using chemical-induced proximity (CIP), we find that the valency of H3K79 methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-) is determined by nucleosome turnover rates. Furthermore, propagation of this mark is predicted by nucleosome turnover simulations over the genome and accounts for the asymmetric distribution of H3K79me toward the transcriptional unit. More broadly, a meta-analysis of other conserved histone modifications demonstrates that nucleosome turnover models predict both valency and chromosomal propagation of methylation marks. Based on data from worms, flies, and mice, we propose that the turnover of modified nucleosomes is a general means of propagation of epigenetic marks and a determinant of methylation valence.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Najafi, Masoud</author><author>Farhood, Bagher</author><author>Mortezaee, Keywan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cancer stem cells (CSCs) in cancer progression and therapy.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cellular physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cellular physiology</full-title></periodical><pages>8381-8395</pages><volume>234</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>CD133</keyword><keyword>CD44</keyword><keyword>CSC niche</keyword><keyword>Notch</keyword><keyword>WNT</keyword><keyword>cancer cell</keyword><keyword>cancer stem cell (CSC)</keyword><keyword>cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)</keyword><keyword>dedifferentiation</keyword><keyword>epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)</keyword><keyword>hypoxia</keyword><keyword>therapy resistance</keyword><keyword>transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)</keyword><keyword>tumor microenvironment (TME)</keyword><keyword>β-catenin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30417375</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jcp.27740</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Najafi, Farhood, Mortezaee - Journal of cellular physiology - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) in cancer progression and therapy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30417375</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are self-renewable cell types that are identified in most types of liquid and solid cancers and contributed to tumor onset, expansion, resistance, recurrence, and metastasis after therapy. CSCs are identified from the expression of cell surface markers, which is tumor-type dependent. The transition between CSCs with cancer cells and other non-CSCs occurs in cancers, which is possibly under the control of signals from CSCs and tumor microenvironment (TME), including CSC niche. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are among the most influential cells for promoting both differentiation of CSCs and dedifferentiation of non-CSCs toward attaining a CSC-like phenotype. WNT/β-catenin, transforming growth factor-β, Hedgehog, and Notch are important signals for maintaining self-renewal in CSCs. An effective therapeutic strategy relies on targeting both CSCs and non-CSCs to remove a possible chance of tumor relapse. There are multiple ways to target CSCs, including immunotherapy, hormone therapy, (mi)siRNA delivery, and gene knockout. Such approaches can be designed for suppressing CSC stemness, tumorigenic cues from TME, CSC extrinsic and/or intrinsic signaling, hypoxia or for promoting differentiation in the cells. Because of sharing a range of characteristics to normal stem/progenitor cells, CSCs must be targeted based on their unique markers and their preferential expression of antigens.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gómez Tejeda Zañudo, Jorge</author><author>Guinn, M Tyler</author><author>Farquhar, Kevin</author><author>Szenk, Mariola</author><author>Steinway, Steven N</author><author>Balázsi, Gábor</author><author>Albert, Réka</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards control of cellular decision-making networks in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition</title><secondary-title>Physical Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physical Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>031002</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition</keyword><keyword>network control</keyword><keyword>network motifs</keyword><keyword>synthetic biology</keyword><keyword>systems biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/1478-3975/aaffa1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Gómez Tejeda Zañudo et al. - Physical Biology - Towards control of cellular decision-making networks in the epithelial-to-mesen.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We present the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) from two perspectives: experimental/technological and theoretical.

We review the mathematical models of the regulatory networks involved in EMT, with a particular emphasis on the network motifs (such as coupled feedback loops) that can generate hybrid states that are intermediate between the epithelial and mesenchymal states. Ultimately, the understanding gained about these networks should be translated into methods to control phenotypic outcomes, especially in the context of cancer therapeutic strategies.

Calpains are a conserved family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteinases with ubiquitous or tissue-specific expression. Accumulating evidence indicates a central role for calpains in tumor migration and invasion via participating in several key processes, including focal adhesion dynamics, cytoskeletal remodeling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and apoptosis. Activated after the increased intracellular calcium concentration ( [ Ca 2 + ] i ) induced by membrane channels and extracellular or intracellular stimuli, calpains induce the limited cleavage or functional modulation of various substrates that serve as metastatic mediators. This review covers established literature to summarize the mechanisms and underlying signaling pathways of calpains in cancer metastasis, making calpains attractive targets for aggressive tumor therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chittock, Emily C</author><author>Latwiel, Sebastian</author><author>Miller, Thomas C R</author><author>Müller, Christoph W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular architecture of polycomb repressive complexes.</title><secondary-title>Biochemical Society transactions</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical Society transactions</full-title></periodical><pages>193-205</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>PR-DUB</keyword><keyword>PRC1</keyword><keyword>PRC2</keyword><keyword>polycomb group protein</keyword><keyword>transcription regulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28202673</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1042/BST20160173</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Chittock et al. - Biochemical Society transactions - Molecular architecture of polycomb repressive complexes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/content/ppbiost/45/1/193.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28202673</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5310723</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The polycomb group (PcG) proteins are a large and diverse family that epigenetically repress the transcription of key developmental genes. They form three broad groups of polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) known as PRC1, PRC2 and Polycomb Repressive DeUBiquitinase, each of which modifies and/or remodels chromatin by distinct mechanisms that are tuned by having variable compositions of core and accessory subunits. Until recently, relatively little was known about how the various PcG proteins assemble to form the PRCs; however, studies by several groups have now allowed us to start piecing together the PcG puzzle.

Depending on the contextual signals and intracellular gene circuits of a particular cell, this program can drive fully epithelial cells to enter into a series of phenotypic states arrayed along the epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypic axis. These cell states display distinctive cellular characteristics, including stemness, invasiveness, drug-resistance and the ability to form metastases at distant organs, and thereby contribute to cancer metastasis and relapse. Currently we still lack a coherent overview of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms inducing cells to enter various states along the epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypic spectrum. An improved understanding of the dynamic and plastic nature of the EMT program has the potential to yield novel therapies targeting this cellular program that may aid in the management of high-grade malignancies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tripathi, Kiran</author><author>Garg, Minal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanistic regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through RAS signaling pathway and therapeutic implications in human cancer.</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell communication and signaling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell communication and signaling</full-title></periodical><pages>513-527</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>EMT-activating transcription factors</keyword><keyword>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)</keyword><keyword>MicroRNAs</keyword><keyword>RAS activation and effector proteins</keyword><keyword>RAS signaling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29330773</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12079-017-0441-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Tripathi, Garg - Journal of cell communication and signaling - Mechanistic regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition thr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s12079-017-0441-3</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330773</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6039341</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>RAS effector signaling instead of being simple, unidirectional and linear cascade, is actually recognized as highly complex and dynamic signaling network. RAF-MEK-ERK cascade, being at the center of complex signaling network, links to multiple scaffold proteins through feed forward and feedback mechanisms and dynamically regulate tumor initiation and progression. Three isoforms of Ras harbor mutations in a cell and tissue specific manner. Besides mutations, their epigenetic silencing also attributes them to exhibit oncogenic activities. Recent evidences support the functions of RAS oncoproteins in the acquisition of tumor cells with Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) features/ epithelial plasticity, enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival. Google Scholar electronic databases and PubMed were searched for original papers and reviews available till date to collect information on stimulation of EMT core inducers in a Ras driven cancer and their regulation in metastatic spread. Improved understanding of the mechanistic basis of regulatory interactions of microRNAs (miRs) and EMT by reprogramming the expression of targets in Ras activated cancer, may help in designing effective anticancer therapies. Apparent lack of adverse events associated with the delivery of miRs and tissue response make 'drug target miRNA' an ideal therapeutic tool to achieve progression free clinical response.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guenther, Matthew G</author><author>Frampton, Garrett M</author><author>Soldner, Frank</author><author>Hockemeyer, Dirk</author><author>Mitalipova, Maya</author><author>Jaenisch, Rudolf</author><author>Young, Richard A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chromatin structure and gene expression programs of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells.</title><secondary-title>Cell stem cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell stem cell</full-title></periodical><pages>249-57</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>STEMCELL</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20682450</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.stem.2010.06.015</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Guenther et al. - Cell stem cell - Chromatin structure and gene expression programs of human embryonic and induced pluripotent st.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1934-5909%2810%2900330-9</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20682450</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3010384</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Knowledge of both the global chromatin structure and the gene expression programs of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) should provide a robust means to assess whether the genomes of these cells have similar pluripotent states.

We describe here a comparison of global chromatin structure and gene expression data for a panel of human ESCs and iPSCs. Genome-wide maps of nucleosomes with histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications indicate that there is little difference between ESCs and iPSCs with respect to these marks. Gene expression profiles confirm that the transcriptional programs of ESCs and iPSCs show very few consistent differences. Although some variation in chromatin structure and gene expression was observed in these cell lines, these variations did not serve to distinguish ESCs from iPSCs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bernstein, Bradley E</author><author>Stamatoyannopoulos, John A</author><author>Costello, Joseph F</author><author>Ren, Bing</author><author>Milosavljevic, Aleksandar</author><author>Meissner, Alexander</author><author>Kellis, Manolis</author><author>Marra, Marco A</author><author>Beaudet, Arthur L</author><author>Ecker, Joseph R</author><author>Farnham, Peggy J</author><author>Hirst, Martin</author><author>Lander, Eric S</author><author>Mikkelsen, Tarjei S</author><author>Thomson, James A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium.</title><secondary-title>Nature biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>1045-8</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20944595</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nbt1010-1045</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Bernstein et al. - Nature biotechnology - The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1010-1045</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20944595</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3607281</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium aims to produce a public resource of epigenomic maps for stem cells and primary ex vivo tissues selected to represent the normal counterparts of tissues and organ systems frequently involved in human disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meissner, Alexander</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epigenetic modifications in pluripotent and differentiated cells.</title><secondary-title>Nature biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>1079-88</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20944600</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nbt.1684</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Meissner - Nature biotechnology - Epigenetic modifications in pluripotent and differentiated cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20944600</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Epigenetic modifications constitute a complex regulatory layer on top of the genome sequence. Pluripotent and differentiated cells provide a powerful system for investigating how the epigenetic code influences cellular fate. High-throughput sequencing of these cell types has yielded DNA methylation maps at single-nucleotide resolution and many genome-wide chromatin maps. In parallel to epigenome mapping efforts, remarkable progress has been made in our ability to manipulate cell states; ectopic expression of transcription factors has been shown to override developmentally established epigenetic marks and to enable routine generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Despite these advances, many fundamental questions remain. The roles of epigenetic marks and, in particular, of epigenetic modifiers in development and in disease states are not well understood. Although iPS cells appear molecularly and functionally similar to embryonic stem cells, more genome-wide studies are needed to define the extent and functions of epigenetic remodeling during reprogramming.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hansen, Kasper Daniel</author><author>Timp, Winston</author><author>Bravo, Héctor Corrada</author><author>Sabunciyan, Sarven</author><author>Langmead, Benjamin</author><author>McDonald, Oliver G</author><author>Wen, Bo</author><author>Wu, Hao</author><author>Liu, Yun</author><author>Diep, Dinh</author><author>Briem, Eirikur</author><author>Zhang, Kun</author><author>Irizarry, Rafael A</author><author>Feinberg, Andrew P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increased methylation variation in epigenetic domains across cancer types.</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>768-75</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21706001</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng.865</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Hansen et al. - Nature genetics - Increased methylation variation in epigenetic domains across cancer types.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.865.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21706001</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3145050</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Tumor heterogeneity is a major barrier to effective cancer diagnosis and treatment. We recently identified cancer-specific differentially DNA-methylated regions (cDMRs) in colon cancer, which also distinguish normal tissue types from each other, suggesting that these cDMRs might be generalized across cancer types. Here we show stochastic methylation variation of the same cDMRs, distinguishing cancer from normal tissue, in colon, lung, breast, thyroid and Wilms' tumors, with intermediate variation in adenomas. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing shows these variable cDMRs are related to loss of sharply delimited methylation boundaries at CpG islands. Furthermore, we find hypomethylation of discrete blocks encompassing half the genome, with extreme gene expression variability. Genes associated with the cDMRs and large blocks are involved in mitosis and matrix remodeling, respectively. We suggest a model for cancer involving loss of epigenetic stability of well-defined genomic domains that underlies increased methylation variability in cancer that may contribute to tumor heterogeneity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ernst, Jason</author><author>Kheradpour, Pouya</author><author>Mikkelsen, Tarjei S</author><author>Shoresh, Noam</author><author>Ward, Lucas D</author><author>Epstein, Charles B</author><author>Zhang, Xiaolan</author><author>Wang, Li</author><author>Issner, Robbyn</author><author>Coyne, Michael</author><author>Ku, Manching</author><author>Durham, Timothy</author><author>Kellis, Manolis</author><author>Bernstein, Bradley E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping and analysis of chromatin state dynamics in nine human cell types.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>43-9</pages><volume>473</volume><issue>7345</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21441907</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature09906</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Ernst et al. - Nature - Mapping and analysis of chromatin state dynamics in nine human cell types.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09906.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21441907</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3088773</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Chromatin profiling has emerged as a powerful means of genome annotation and detection of regulatory activity. The approach is especially well suited to the characterization of non-coding portions of the genome, which critically contribute to cellular phenotypes yet remain largely uncharted. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell-type specificities and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell-type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multicell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell-type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease single nucleotide polymorphisms are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus suggesting a mechanism for the association. Our study presents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory connections and their roles in disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tan, Minjia</author><author>Luo, Hao</author><author>Lee, Sangkyu</author><author>Jin, Fulai</author><author>Yang, Jeong Soo</author><author>Montellier, Emilie</author><author>Buchou, Thierry</author><author>Cheng, Zhongyi</author><author>Rousseaux, Sophie</author><author>Rajagopal, Nisha</author><author>Lu, Zhike</author><author>Ye, Zhen</author><author>Zhu, Qin</author><author>Wysocka, Joanna</author><author>Ye, Yang</author><author>Khochbin, Saadi</author><author>Ren, Bing</author><author>Zhao, Yingming</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of 67 histone marks and histone lysine crotonylation as a new type of histone modification.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>1016-28</pages><volume>146</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21925322</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Tan et al. - Cell - Identification of 67 histone marks and histone lysine crotonylation as a new type of histone modification.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2811%2900891-9</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21925322</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3176443</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We report the identification of 67 previously undescribed histone modifications, increasing the current number of known histone marks by about 70%.

Specifically, in both human somatic and mouse male germ cell genomes, histone Kcr marks either active promoters or potential enhancers. In male germinal cells immediately following meiosis, Kcr is enriched on sex chromosomes and specifically marks testis-specific genes, including a significant proportion of X-linked genes that escape sex chromosome inactivation in haploid cells. These results therefore dramatically extend the repertoire of histone PTM sites and designate Kcr as a specific mark of active sex chromosome-linked genes in postmeiotic male germ cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yusuf, Dimas</author><author>Butland, Stefanie L</author><author>Swanson, Magdalena I</author><author>Bolotin, Eugene</author><author>Ticoll, Amy</author><author>Cheung, Warren A</author><author>Zhang, Xiao Yu Cindy</author><author>Dickman, Christopher T D</author><author>Fulton, Debra L</author><author>Lim, Jonathan S</author><author>Schnabl, Jake M</author><author>Ramos, Oscar H P</author><author>Vasseur-Cognet, Mireille</author><author>de Leeuw, Charles N</author><author>Simpson, Elizabeth M</author><author>Ryffel, Gerhart U</author><author>Lam, Eric W-F</author><author>Kist, Ralf</author><author>Wilson, Miranda S C</author><author>Marco-Ferreres, Raquel</author><author>Brosens, Jan J</author><author>Beccari, Leonardo L</author><author>Bovolenta, Paola</author><author>Benayoun, Bérénice A</author><author>Monteiro, Lara J</author><author>Schwenen, Helma D C</author><author>Grontved, Lars</author><author>Wederell, Elizabeth</author><author>Mandrup, Susanne</author><author>Veitia, Reiner A</author><author>Chakravarthy, Harini</author><author>Hoodless, Pamela A</author><author>Mancarelli, M Michela</author><author>Torbett, Bruce E</author><author>Banham, Alison H</author><author>Reddy, Sekhar P</author><author>Cullum, Rebecca L</author><author>Liedtke, Michaela</author><author>Tschan, Mario P</author><author>Vaz, Michelle</author><author>Rizzino, Angie</author><author>Zannini, Mariastella</author><author>Frietze, Seth</author><author>Farnham, Peggy J</author><author>Eijkelenboom, Astrid</author><author>Brown, Philip J</author><author>Laperrière, David</author><author>Leprince, Dominique</author><author>de Cristofaro, Tiziana</author><author>Prince, Kelly L</author><author>Putker, Marrit</author><author>del Peso, Luis</author><author>Camenisch, Gieri</author><author>Wenger, Roland H</author><author>Mikula, Michal</author><author>Rozendaal, Marieke</author><author>Mader, Sylvie</author><author>Ostrowski, Jerzy</author><author>Rhodes, Simon J</author><author>Van Rechem, Capucine</author><author>Boulay, Gaylor</author><author>Olechnowicz, Sam W Z</author><author>Breslin, Mary B</author><author>Lan, Michael S</author><author>Nanan, Kyster K</author><author>Wegner, Michael</author><author>Hou, Juan</author><author>Mullen, Rachel D</author><author>Colvin, Stephanie C</author><author>Noy, Peter John</author><author>Webb, Carol F</author><author>Witek, Matthew E</author><author>Ferrell, Scott</author><author>Daniel, Juliet M</author><author>Park, Jason</author><author>Waldman, Scott A</author><author>Peet, Daniel J</author><author>Taggart, Michael</author><author>Jayaraman, Padma-Sheela</author><author>Karrich, Julien J</author><author>Blom, Bianca</author><author>Vesuna, Farhad</author><author>O'Geen, Henriette</author><author>Sun, Yunfu</author><author>Gronostajski, Richard M</author><author>Woodcroft, Mark W</author><author>Hough, Margaret R</author><author>Chen, Edwin</author><author>Europe-Finner, G Nicholas</author><author>Karolczak-Bayatti, Magdalena</author><author>Bailey, Jarrod</author><author>Hankinson, Oliver</author><author>Raman, Venu</author><author>LeBrun, David P</author><author>Biswal, Shyam</author><author>Harvey, Christopher J</author><author>DeBruyne, Jason P</author><author>Hogenesch, John B</author><author>Hevner, Robert F</author><author>Héligon, Christophe</author><author>Luo, Xin M</author><author>Blank, Marissa Cathleen</author><author>Millen, Kathleen Joyce</author><author>Sharlin, David S</author><author>Forrest, Douglas</author><author>Dahlman-Wright, Karin</author><author>Zhao, Chunyan</author><author>Mishima, Yuriko</author><author>Sinha, Satrajit</author><author>Chakrabarti, Rumela</author><author>Portales-Casamar, Elodie</author><author>Sladek, Frances M</author><author>Bradley, Philip H</author><author>Wasserman, Wyeth W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The transcription factor encyclopedia.</title><secondary-title>Genome biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome biology</full-title></periodical><pages>R24</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22458515</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/gb-2012-13-3-r24</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 -

Here, we investigate how inhibition of the widely expressed transcriptional coactivator BRD4 leads to selective inhibition of the MYC oncogene in multiple myeloma (MM). BRD4 and Mediator were found to co-occupy thousands of enhancers associated with active genes. They also co-occupied a small set of exceptionally large super-enhancers associated with genes that feature prominently in MM biology, including the MYC oncogene. Treatment of MM tumor cells with the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 led to preferential loss of BRD4 at super-enhancers and consequent transcription elongation defects that preferentially impacted genes with super-enhancers, including MYC. Super-enhancers were found at key oncogenic drivers in many other tumor cells. These observations have implications for the discovery of cancer therapeutics directed at components of super-enhancers in diverse tumor types.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Magklara, Angeliki</author><author>Lomvardas, Stavros</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stochastic gene expression in mammals: lessons from olfaction.</title><secondary-title>Trends in cell biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in cell biology</full-title></periodical><pages>449-56</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>antigen receptors</keyword><keyword>clustered protocadherins</keyword><keyword>epigenetic mechanisms</keyword><keyword>nuclear architecture</keyword><keyword>olfactory receptors</keyword><keyword>stochasticity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23689023</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tcb.2013.04.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Magklara, Lomvardas - Trends in cell biology - Stochastic gene expression in mammals lessons from olfaction.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2013.04.005</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23689023</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3755038</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>One of the remarkable characteristics of higher organisms is the enormous assortment of cell types that emerge from a common genome. The immune system, with the daunting duty of detecting an astounding number of pathogens, and the nervous system with the equally bewildering task of perceiving and interpreting the external world, are the quintessence of cellular diversity. As we began to appreciate decades ago, achieving distinct expression programs among similar cell types cannot be accomplished solely by deterministic regulatory systems, but by the involvement of some type of stochasticity. In the last few years our understanding of these non-deterministic mechanisms is advancing, and this review will provide a brief summary of the current view of stochastic gene expression with focus on olfactory receptor (OR) gene choice, the epigenetic underpinnings of which recently began to emerge.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium</author><author>Kundaje, Anshul</author><author>Meuleman, Wouter</author><author>Ernst, Jason</author><author>Bilenky, Misha</author><author>Yen, Angela</author><author>Heravi-Moussavi, Alireza</author><author>Kheradpour, Pouya</author><author>Zhang, Zhizhuo</author><author>Wang, Jianrong</author><author>Ziller, Michael J</author><author>Amin, Viren</author><author>Whitaker, John W</author><author>Schultz, Matthew D</author><author>Ward, Lucas D</author><author>Sarkar, Abhishek</author><author>Quon, Gerald</author><author>Sandstrom, Richard S</author><author>Eaton, Matthew L</author><author>Wu, Yi-Chieh</author><author>Pfenning, Andreas R</author><author>Wang, Xinchen</author><author>Claussnitzer, Melina</author><author>Liu, Yaping</author><author>Coarfa, Cristian</author><author>Harris, R Alan</author><author>Shoresh, Noam</author><author>Epstein, Charles B</author><author>Gjoneska, Elizabeta</author><author>Leung, Danny</author><author>Xie, Wei</author><author>Hawkins, R David</author><author>Lister, Ryan</author><author>Hong, Chibo</author><author>Gascard, Philippe</author><author>Mungall, Andrew J</author><author>Moore, Richard</author><author>Chuah, Eric</author><author>Tam, Angela</author><author>Canfield, Theresa K</author><author>Hansen, R Scott</author><author>Kaul, Rajinder</author><author>Sabo, Peter J</author><author>Bansal, Mukul S</author><author>Carles, Annaick</author><author>Dixon, Jesse R</author><author>Farh, Kai-How</author><author>Feizi, Soheil</author><author>Karlic, Rosa</author><author>Kim, Ah-Ram</author><author>Kulkarni, Ashwinikumar</author><author>Li, Daofeng</author><author>Lowdon, Rebecca</author><author>Elliott, Ginell</author><author>Mercer, Tim R</author><author>Neph, Shane J</author><author>Onuchic, Vitor</author><author>Polak, Paz</author><author>Rajagopal, Nisha</author><author>Ray, Pradipta</author><author>Sallari, Richard C</author><author>Siebenthall, Kyle T</author><author>Sinnott-Armstrong, Nicholas A</author><author>Stevens, Michael</author><author>Thurman, Robert E</author><author>Wu, Jie</author><author>Zhang, Bo</author><author>Zhou, Xin</author><author>Beaudet, Arthur E</author><author>Boyer, Laurie A</author><author>De Jager, Philip L</author><author>Farnham, Peggy J</author><author>Fisher, Susan J</author><author>Haussler, David</author><author>Jones, Steven J M</author><author>Li, Wei</author><author>Marra, Marco A</author><author>McManus, Michael T</author><author>Sunyaev, Shamil</author><author>Thomson, James A</author><author>Tlsty, Thea D</author><author>Tsai, Li-Huei</author><author>Wang, Wei</author><author>Waterland, Robert A</author><author>Zhang, Michael Q</author><author>Chadwick, Lisa H</author><author>Bernstein, Bradley E</author><author>Costello, Joseph F</author><author>Ecker, Joseph R</author><author>Hirst, Martin</author><author>Meissner, Alexander</author><author>Milosavljevic, Aleksandar</author><author>Ren, Bing</author><author>Stamatoyannopoulos, John A</author><author>Wang, Ting</author><author>Kellis, Manolis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>317-30</pages><volume>518</volume><issue>7539</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25693563</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature14248</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al. - Nature - Integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25693563</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4530010</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic variation and its association with human disease, but epigenomic studies lack a similar reference. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rheinbay, Esther</author><author>Suvà, Mario L</author><author>Gillespie, Shawn M</author><author>Wakimoto, Hiroaki</author><author>Patel, Anoop P</author><author>Shahid, Mohammad</author><author>Oksuz, Ozgur</author><author>Rabkin, Samuel D</author><author>Martuza, Robert L</author><author>Rivera, Miguel N</author><author>Louis, David N</author><author>Kasif, Simon</author><author>Chi, Andrew S</author><author>Bernstein, Bradley E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An aberrant transcription factor network essential for Wnt signaling and stem cell maintenance in glioblastoma.</title><secondary-title>Cell reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1567-79</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23707066</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.celrep.2013.04.021</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Rheinbay et al. - Cell reports - An aberrant transcription factor network essential for Wnt signaling and stem cell maintenance i.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2013.04.021</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23707066</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3774301</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Glioblastoma (GBM) is thought to be driven by a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that self-renew and recapitulate tumor heterogeneity yet remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comparative analysis of chromatin state in GBM CSCs that reveals widespread activation of genes normally held in check by Polycomb repressors. These activated targets include a large set of developmental transcription factors (TFs) whose coordinated activation is unique to the CSCs. We demonstrate that a critical factor in the set, ASCL1, activates Wnt signaling by repressing the negative regulator DKK1. We show that ASCL1 is essential for the maintenance and in vivo tumorigenicity of GBM CSCs. Genome-wide binding profiles for ASCL1 and the Wnt effector LEF-1 provide mechanistic insight and suggest widespread interactions between the TF module and the signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate regulatory connections among ASCL1, Wnt signaling, and collaborating TFs that are essential for the maintenance and tumorigenicity of GBM CSCs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Polak, Paz</author><author>Karlić, Rosa</author><author>Koren, Amnon</author><author>Thurman, Robert</author><author>Sandstrom, Richard</author><author>Lawrence, Michael</author><author>Reynolds, Alex</author><author>Rynes, Eric</author><author>Vlahoviček, Kristian</author><author>Stamatoyannopoulos, John A</author><author>Sunyaev, Shamil R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell-of-origin chromatin organization shapes the mutational landscape of cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>360-364</pages><volume>518</volume><issue>7539</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25693567</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature14221</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Polak et al. - Nature - Cell-of-origin chromatin organization shapes the mutational landscape of cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14221.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25693567</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4405175</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancer is a disease potentiated by mutations in somatic cells. Cancer mutations are not distributed uniformly along the human genome. Instead, different human genomic regions vary by up to fivefold in the local density of cancer somatic mutations, posing a fundamental problem for statistical methods used in cancer genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as a major determinant of the cancer mutational landscape. However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are highly cell-type-specific. We investigated the distribution of mutations in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer types and compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic features. Here we show that chromatin accessibility and modification, together with replication timing, explain up to 86% of the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes. The best predictors of local somatic mutation density are epigenomic features derived from the most likely cell type of origin of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find that cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin features of matched cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately determined based on the distribution of mutations along its genome. Thus, the DNA sequence of a cancer genome encompasses a wealth of information about the identity and epigenomic features of its cell of origin.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hnisz, Denes</author><author>Abraham, Brian J</author><author>Lee, Tong Ihn</author><author>Lau, Ashley</author><author>Saint-André, Violaine</author><author>Sigova, Alla A</author><author>Hoke, Heather A</author><author>Young, Richard A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Super-enhancers in the control of cell identity and disease.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>934-47</pages><volume>155</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24119843</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.053</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Hnisz et al. - Cell - Super-enhancers in the control of cell identity and disease.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.053</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24119843</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3841062</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Super-enhancers are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive expression of genes that define cell identity. Improved understanding of the roles that super-enhancers play in biology would be afforded by knowing the constellation of factors that constitute these domains and by identifying super-enhancers across the spectrum of human cell types. We describe here the population of transcription factors, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and transcription apparatus occupying super-enhancers in embryonic stem cells and evidence that super-enhancers are highly transcribed. We produce a catalog of super-enhancers in a broad range of human cell types and find that super-enhancers associate with genes that control and define the biology of these cells. Interestingly, disease-associated variation is especially enriched in the super-enhancers of disease-relevant cell types. Furthermore, we find that cancer cells generate super-enhancers at oncogenes and other genes important in tumor pathogenesis. Thus, super-enhancers play key roles in human cell identity in health and in disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, Fulai</author><author>Li, Yan</author><author>Dixon, Jesse R</author><author>Selvaraj, Siddarth</author><author>Ye, Zhen</author><author>Lee, Ah Young</author><author>Yen, Chia-An</author><author>Schmitt, Anthony D</author><author>Espinoza, Celso A</author><author>Ren, Bing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A high-resolution map of the three-dimensional chromatin interactome in human cells.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>290-4</pages><volume>503</volume><issue>7475</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24141950</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature12644</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Jin et al. - Nature - A high-resolution map of the three-dimensional chromatin interactome in human cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12644.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24141950</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3838900</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A large number of cis-regulatory sequences have been annotated in the human genome, but defining their target genes remains a challenge. One strategy is to identify the long-range looping interactions at these elements with the use of chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques. However, previous studies lack either the resolution or coverage to permit a whole-genome, unbiased view of chromatin interactions. Here we report a comprehensive chromatin interaction map generated in human fibroblasts using a genome-wide 3C analysis method (Hi-C). We determined over one million long-range chromatin interactions at 5-10-kb resolution, and uncovered general principles of chromatin organization at different types of genomic features. We also characterized the dynamics of promoter-enhancer contacts after TNF-α signalling in these cells. Unexpectedly, we found that TNF-α-responsive enhancers are already in contact with their target promoters before signalling. Such pre-existing chromatin looping, which also exists in other cell types with different extracellular signalling, is a strong predictor of gene induction. Our observations suggest that the three-dimensional chromatin landscape, once established in a particular cell type, is relatively stable and could influence the selection or activation of target genes by a ubiquitous transcription activator in a cell-specific manner.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gorkin, David U</author><author>Leung, Danny</author><author>Ren, Bing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 3D genome in transcriptional regulation and pluripotency.</title><secondary-title>Cell stem cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell stem cell</full-title></periodical><pages>762-75</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24905166</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.stem.2014.05.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Gorkin, Leung, Ren - Cell stem cell - The 3D genome in transcriptional regulation and pluripotency.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2014.05.017</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905166</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4107214</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>It can be convenient to think of the genome as simply a string of nucleotides, the linear order of which encodes an organism's genetic blueprint. However, the genome does not exist as a linear entity within cells where this blueprint is actually utilized. Inside the nucleus, the genome is organized in three-dimensional (3D) space, and lineage-specific transcriptional programs that direct stem cell fate are implemented in this native 3D context. Here, we review principles of 3D genome organization in mammalian cells. We focus on the emerging relationship between genome organization and lineage-specific transcriptional regulation, which we argue are inextricably linked.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laugesen, Anne</author><author>Helin, Kristian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chromatin repressive complexes in stem cells, development, and cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cell stem cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell stem cell</full-title></periodical><pages>735-51</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24905164</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.stem.2014.05.006</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Laugesen, Helin - Cell stem cell - Chromatin repressive complexes in stem cells, development, and cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2014.05.006</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905164</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The chromatin environment is essential for the correct specification and preservation of cell identity through modulation and maintenance of transcription patterns.

An ability to map the direct interactions of a chemical entity with chromatin genome-wide could provide important insights into chemical perturbation of cellular function. Here we describe a method that couples ligand-affinity capture and massively parallel DNA sequencing (Chem-seq) to identify the sites bound by small chemical molecules throughout the human genome. We show how Chem-seq can be combined with ChIP-seq to gain unique insights into the interaction of drugs with their target proteins throughout the genome of tumor cells.

There have been conflicting reports on the question of whether p53 posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation or acetylation, are essential or only play a subtle, fine-tuning role in the p53 response. Thus, it remains unclear whether p53 modification is absolutely required for its activation. We have now identified all major acetylation sites of p53. Although unacetylated p53 retains its ability to induce the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop, loss of acetylation completely abolishes p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis. Notably, acetylation of p53 abrogates Mdm2-mediated repression by blocking the recruitment of Mdm2 to p53-responsive promoters, which leads to p53 activation independent of its phosphorylation status. Our study identifies p53 acetylation as an indispensable event that destabilizes the p53-Mdm2 interaction and enables the p53-mediated stress response.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Mierlo, Guido</author><author>Dirks, René A M</author><author>De Clerck, Laura</author><author>Brinkman, Arie B.</author><author>Huth, Michelle</author><author>Kloet, Susan L.</author><author>Saksouk, Nehmé</author><author>Kroeze, Leonie I.</author><author>Willems, Sander</author><author>Farlik, Matthias</author><author>Bock, Christoph</author><author>Jansen, Joop H.</author><author>Deforce, Dieter</author><author>Vermeulen, Michiel</author><author>Déjardin, Jérôme</author><author>Dhaenens, Maarten</author><author>Marks, Hendrik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrative Proteomic Profiling Reveals PRC2-Dependent Epigenetic Crosstalk Maintains Ground-State Pluripotency.</title><secondary-title>Cell stem cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell stem cell</full-title></periodical><pages>123-137.e8</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>H3K27me3</keyword><keyword>chromatin profiling</keyword><keyword>embryonic stem cells</keyword><keyword>epigenetics</keyword><keyword>ground-state pluripotency</keyword><keyword>histone modifications</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30472157</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.stem.2018.10.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - van Mierlo et al. - Cell stem cell - Integrative Proteomic Profiling Reveals PRC2-Dependent Epigenetic Crosstalk Maintains Ground.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30472157</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The pluripotent ground state is defined as a basal state free of epigenetic restrictions, which influence lineage specification. While naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be maintained in a hypomethylated state with open chromatin when grown using two small-molecule inhibitors (2i)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), in contrast to serum/LIF-grown ESCs that resemble early post-implantation embryos, broader features of the ground-state pluripotent epigenome are not well understood. We identified epigenetic features of mouse ESCs cultured using 2i/LIF or serum/LIF by proteomic profiling of chromatin-associated complexes and histone modifications. Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and its product H3K27me3 are highly abundant in 2i/LIF ESCs, and H3K27me3 is distributed genome-wide in a CpG-dependent fashion. Consistently, PRC2-deficient ESCs showed increased DNA methylation at sites normally occupied by H3K27me3 and increased H4 acetylation. Inhibiting DNA methylation in PRC2-deficient ESCs did not affect their viability or transcriptome. Our findings suggest a unique H3K27me3 configuration protects naive ESCs from lineage priming, and they reveal widespread epigenetic crosstalk in ground-state pluripotency.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laugesen, Anne</author><author>Højfeldt, Jonas Westergaard</author><author>Helin, Kristian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular Mechanisms Directing PRC2 Recruitment and H3K27 Methylation.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cell</full-title></periodical><pages>8-18</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>EZH2</keyword><keyword>H3K27</keyword><keyword>PRC2</keyword><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>chromatin</keyword><keyword>epigenetics</keyword><keyword>gene expression</keyword><keyword>histone methylation</keyword><keyword>polycomb</keyword><keyword>transcription</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>30951652</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molcel.2019.03.011</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Laugesen, Højfeldt, Helin - Molecular cell - Molecular Mechanisms Directing PRC2 Recruitment and H3K27 Methylation(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276519301856</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30951652</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6452890</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a chromatin-associated methyltransferase catalyzing mono-, di-, and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27).

PRC2 function is often deregulated in disease and is a promising candidate for therapeutic targeting in cancer. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms proposed to take part in modulating PRC2 recruitment and shaping H3K27 methylation patterns across the genome. This includes consideration of factors influencing PRC2 residence time on chromatin and PRC2 catalytic activity with a focus on the mechanisms giving rise to regional preferences and differential deposition of H3K27 methylation.

Using high-throughput affinity-purification mass spectrometry, we identify interacting partners for 2,594 human proteins in HEK293T cells. The resulting network (BioPlex) contains 23,744 interactions among 7,668 proteins with 86% previously undocumented. BioPlex accurately depicts known complexes, attaining 80%-100% coverage for most CORUM complexes. The network readily subdivides into communities that correspond to complexes or clusters of functionally related proteins. More generally, network architecture reflects cellular localization, biological process, and molecular function, enabling functional characterization of thousands of proteins. Network structure also reveals associations among thousands of protein domains, suggesting a basis for examining structurally related proteins. Finally, BioPlex, in combination with other approaches, can be used to reveal interactions of biological or clinical significance. For example, mutations in the membrane protein VAPB implicated in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis perturb a defined community of interactors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Wensheng</author><author>Chronis, Constantinos</author><author>Chen, Xi</author><author>Zhang, Heyao</author><author>Spalinskas, Rapolas</author><author>Pardo, Mercedes</author><author>Chen, Liangliang</author><author>Wu, Guangming</author><author>Zhu, Zhexin</author><author>Yu, Yong</author><author>Yu, Lu</author><author>Choudhary, Jyoti</author><author>Nichols, Jennifer</author><author>Parast, Mana M.</author><author>Greber, Boris</author><author>Sahlén, Pelin</author><author>Plath, Kathrin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The BAF and PRC2 Complex Subunits Dpf2 and Eed Antagonistically Converge on Tbx3 to Control ESC Differentiation.</title><secondary-title>Cell stem cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell stem cell</full-title></periodical><pages>138-152.e8</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>BAF complex</keyword><keyword>PRC2 complex</keyword><keyword>cell fate decision</keyword><keyword>differentiation</keyword><keyword>embryonic stem cells</keyword><keyword>enhancers</keyword><keyword>histone modification</keyword><keyword>pluripotency</keyword><keyword>self-renewal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30609396</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.stem.2018.12.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Zhang et al. - Cell stem cell - The BAF and PRC2 Complex Subunits Dpf2 and Eed Antagonistically Converge on Tbx3 to Control ESC D.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30609396</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BAF complexes are composed of different subunits with varying functional and developmental roles, although many subunits have not been examined in depth. Here we show that the Baf45 subunit Dpf2 maintains pluripotency and ESC differentiation potential. Dpf2 co-occupies enhancers with Oct4, Sox2, p300, and the BAF subunit Brg1, and deleting Dpf2 perturbs ESC self-renewal, induces repression of Tbx3, and impairs mesendodermal differentiation without dramatically altering Brg1 localization. Mesendodermal differentiation can be rescued by restoring Tbx3 expression, whose distal enhancer is positively regulated by Dpf2-dependent H3K27ac maintenance and recruitment of pluripotency TFs and Brg1. In contrast, the PRC2 subunit Eed binds an intragenic Tbx3 enhancer to oppose Dpf2-dependent Tbx3 expression and mesendodermal differentiation. The PRC2 subunit Ezh2 likewise opposes Dpf2-dependent differentiation through a distinct mechanism involving Nanog repression. Together, these findings delineate distinct mechanistic roles for specific BAF and PRC2 subunits during ESC differentiation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danishuddin</author><author>Subbarao, Naidu</author><author>Faheem, Mohammad</author><author>Khan, Shahper Nazeer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polycomb repressive complex 2 inhibitors: emerging epigenetic modulators.</title><secondary-title>Drug discovery today</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Drug discovery today</full-title></periodical><pages>179-188</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><accession-num>30031878</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.drudis.2018.07.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Danishuddin et al. - Drug discovery today - Polycomb repressive complex 2 inhibitors emerging epigenetic modulators.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2018.07.002</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031878</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) plays a significant part in histone methylation - trimethylating K27 at H3, an epigenetic hallmark of gene silencing.

METHOD We checked the expression of Snail2 in several clinical CRC specimens. Then, we established Snail2-overexpressing and knockdown cell lines to determine the function of Snail2 during EMT and metastasis processes in CRC. In addition, we used luciferase reporter assay to explore how Snail2 inhibits the expression of E-cadherin and induces EMT. RESULTS We found that the expression of Snail2 was higher in clinical specimens of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to non-cancerous tissues. Overexpression of Snail2 induced migration and metastatic properties in CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of Snail2 promoted the occurrence of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), downregulating the expression of E-cadherin and upregulating that of vimentin. Specifically, Snail2 could interact with HDAC6 and then recruited HDAC6 and PRC2 to the promoter of E-cadherin and thus inhibited the expression of E-cadherin, promoting EMT and inducing invasion and metastasis of CRC. CONCLUSION Our study reveals that Snail2 might epigenetically suppress the expression of E-cadherin during CRC metastasis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Al-Raawi, Diaa</author><author>Jones, Rhian</author><author>Wijesinghe, Susanne</author><author>Halsall, John</author><author>Petric, Marija</author><author>Roberts, Sally</author><author>Hotchin, Neil A</author><author>Kanhere, Aditi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel form of JARID2 is required for differentiation in lineage-committed cells.</title><secondary-title>The EMBO journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The EMBO journal</full-title></periodical><pages>e98449</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>JARID2</keyword><keyword>N‐terminal domain</keyword><keyword>cell differentiation</keyword><keyword>polycomb</keyword><keyword>proteolytic cleavage</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30573669</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.15252/embj.201798449</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Al-Raawi et al. - The EMBO journal - A novel form of JARID2 is required for differentiation in lineage-committed cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://emboj.embopress.org/content/embojnl/38/3/e98449.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573669</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6356158</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) is a group of proteins that play an important role during development and in cell differentiation. PRC2 is a histone-modifying complex that catalyses methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) at differentiation genes leading to their transcriptional repression. JARID2 is a co-factor of PRC2 and is important for targeting PRC2 to chromatin. Here, we show that, unlike in embryonic stem cells, in lineage-committed human cells, including human epidermal keratinocytes, JARID2 predominantly exists as a novel low molecular weight form, which lacks the N-terminal PRC2-interacting domain (ΔN-JARID2). We show that ΔN-JARID2 is a cleaved product of full-length JARID2 spanning the C-terminal conserved jumonji domains. JARID2 knockout in keratinocytes results in up-regulation of cell cycle genes and repression of many epidermal differentiation genes. Surprisingly, repression of epidermal differentiation genes in JARID2-null keratinocytes can be rescued by expression of ΔN-JARID2 suggesting that, in contrast to PRC2, ΔN-JARID2 promotes activation of differentiation genes. We propose that a switch from expression of full-length JARID2 to ΔN-JARID2 is important for the up-regulation differentiation genes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Min-Hui</author><author>Zhao, Li</author><author>Wang, Lan</author><author>Ou-Yang, Wen</author><author>Hu, Sha-Sha</author><author>Li, Wen-Lu</author><author>Ai, Mei-Ling</author><author>Wang, Yi-Qing</author><author>Han, Yue</author><author>Li, Ting-Ting</author><author>Ding, Yan-Qing</author><author>Wang, Shuang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nuclear lncRNA HOXD-AS1 suppresses colorectal carcinoma growth and metastasis via inhibiting HOXD3-induced integrin β3 transcriptional activating and MAPK/AKT signalling.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>31</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Colorectal carcinoma</keyword><keyword>HOXD-AS1</keyword><keyword>HOXD3</keyword><keyword>PRC2</keyword><keyword>lncRNA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30823921</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12943-019-0955-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Yang et al. - Molecular cancer - Nuclear lncRNA HOXD-AS1 suppresses colorectal carcinoma growth and metastasis via inhibiting HO.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12943-019-0955-9</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30823921</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6397497</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been indicated to play critical roles in cancer development and progression. LncRNA HOXD cluster antisense RNA1 (HOXD-AS1) has recently been found to be dysregulated in several cancers. However, the expression levels, cellular localization, precise function and mechanism of HOXD-AS1 in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) are largely unknown. METHODS Real-time PCR and in situ hybridization were used to detect the expression of HOXD-AS1 in CRC tissue samples and cell lines. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to investigate the biological roles of HOXD-AS1 in CRC cell line. RNA pull down, RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to investigate the mechanisms underlying the functions of HOXD-AS1 in CRC. RESULTS We observed that HOXD-AS1 was located in the nucleus of CRC cells and that nuclear HOXD-AS1 was downregulated in most CRC specimens and cell lines. Lower levels of nuclear HOXD-AS1 expression were associated with poor outcomes of CRC patients. HOXD-AS1 downregulation enhanced proliferation and migration of CRC cells in vitro and facilitated CRC tumourigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that HOXD-AS1 could suppress HOXD3 transcription by recruiting PRC2 to induce the accumulation of the repressive marker H3K27me3 at the HOXD3 promoter. Subsequently, HOXD3, as a transcriptional activator, promoted Integrin β3 transcription, thereby activating the MAPK/AKT signalling pathways. CONCLUSION Our results reveal a previously unrecognized HOXD-AS1-HOXD3-Integrin β3 regulatory axis involving in epigenetic and transcriptional regulation constitutes to CRC carcinogenesis and progression.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cancer Genome Atlas Network</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic Classification of Cutaneous Melanoma.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>1681-96</pages><volume>161</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26091043</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.044</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Cancer Genome Atlas Network - Cell - Genomic Classification of Cutaneous Melanoma.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.044</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091043</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4580370</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We describe the landscape of genomic alterations in cutaneous melanomas through DNA, RNA, and protein-based analysis of 333 primary and/or metastatic melanomas from 331 patients. We establish a framework for genomic classification into one of four subtypes based on the pattern of the most prevalent significantly mutated genes: mutant BRAF, mutant RAS, mutant NF1, and Triple-WT (wild-type). Integrative analysis reveals enrichment of KIT mutations and focal amplifications and complex structural rearrangements as a feature of the Triple-WT subtype. We found no significant outcome correlation with genomic classification, but samples assigned a transcriptomic subclass enriched for immune gene expression associated with lymphocyte infiltrate on pathology review and high LCK protein expression, a T cell marker, were associated with improved patient survival. This clinicopathological and multi-dimensional analysis suggests that the prognosis of melanoma patients with regional metastases is influenced by tumor stroma immunobiology, offering insights to further personalize therapeutic decision-making.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network.

Deep whole-exome sequencing revealed recurrent somatic mutations in KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, RNF43, ARID1A, TGFβR2, GNAS, RREB1, and PBRM1. KRAS wild-type tumors harbored alterations in other oncogenic drivers, including GNAS, BRAF, CTNNB1, and additional RAS pathway genes. A subset of tumors harbored multiple KRAS mutations, with some showing evidence of biallelic mutations. Protein profiling identified a favorable prognosis subset with low epithelial-mesenchymal transition and high MTOR pathway scores. Associations of non-coding RNAs with tumor-specific mRNA subtypes were also identified. Our integrated multi-platform analysis reveals a complex molecular landscape of PDAC and provides a roadmap for precision medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krug, Karsten</author><author>Mertins, Philipp</author><author>Zhang, Bin</author><author>Hornbeck, Peter</author><author>Raju, Rajesh</author><author>Ahmad, Rushdy</author><author>Szucs, Matthew</author><author>Mundt, Filip</author><author>Forestier, Dominique</author><author>Jane-Valbuena, Judit</author><author>Keshishian, Hasmik</author><author>Gillette, Michael A.</author><author>Tamayo, Pablo</author><author>Mesirov, Jill P.</author><author>Jaffe, Jacob D.</author><author>Carr, Steven A.</author><author>Mani, D.

However, pathway analysis of PTM data sets generated by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is typically performed at a gene-centric level because of the lack of appropriately curated PTM signature databases and bioinformatic tools that leverage PTM site-specific information. Here we present the first version of PTMsigDB, a database of modification site-specific signatures of perturbations, kinase activities and signaling pathways curated from more than 2,500 publications. We adapted the widely used single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis approach to utilize PTMsigDB, enabling PTMSignature Enrichment Analysis (PTM-SEA) of quantitative MS data. We used a well-characterized data set of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-perturbed cancer cells to evaluate our approach and demonstrated better representation of signaling events compared with gene-centric methods. We then applied PTM-SEA to analyze the phosphoproteomes of cancer cells treated with cell-cycle inhibitors and detected mechanism-of-action specific signatures of cell cycle kinases. We also applied our methods to analyze the phosphoproteomes of PI3K-inhibited human breast cancer cells and detected signatures of compounds inhibiting PI3K as well as targets downstream of PI3K (AKT, MAPK/ERK) covering a substantial fraction of the PI3K pathway. PTMsigDB and PTM-SEA can be freely accessed at https://github.com/broadinstitute/ssGSEA2.0.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinoma.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>543-50</pages><volume>511</volume><issue>7511</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25079552</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature13385</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network - Nature - Comprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinoma.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/luad_2014/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25079552</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4231481</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Here we report molecular profiling of 230 resected lung adenocarcinomas using messenger RNA, microRNA and DNA sequencing integrated with copy number, methylation and proteomic analyses. High rates of somatic mutation were seen (mean 8.9 mutations per megabase). Eighteen genes were statistically significantly mutated, including RIT1 activating mutations and newly described loss-of-function MGA mutations which are mutually exclusive with focal MYC amplification. EGFR mutations were more frequent in female patients, whereas mutations in RBM10 were more common in males. Aberrations in NF1, MET, ERBB2 and RIT1 occurred in 13% of cases and were enriched in samples otherwise lacking an activated oncogene, suggesting a driver role for these events in certain tumours. DNA and mRNA sequence from the same tumour highlighted splicing alterations driven by somatic genomic changes, including exon 14 skipping in MET mRNA in 4% of cases. MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity, when measured at the protein level, was explained by known mutations in only a fraction of cases, suggesting additional, unexplained mechanisms of pathway activation. These data establish a foundation for classification and further investigations of lung adenocarcinoma molecular pathogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lawrence, Michael S</author><author>Stojanov, Petar</author><author>Polak, Paz</author><author>Kryukov, Gregory V</author><author>Cibulskis, Kristian</author><author>Sivachenko, Andrey</author><author>Carter, Scott L</author><author>Stewart, Chip</author><author>Mermel, Craig H</author><author>Roberts, Steven A</author><author>Kiezun, Adam</author><author>Hammerman, Peter S</author><author>McKenna, Aaron</author><author>Drier, Yotam</author><author>Zou, Lihua</author><author>Ramos, Alex H</author><author>Pugh, Trevor J</author><author>Stransky, Nicolas</author><author>Helman, Elena</author><author>Kim, Jaegil</author><author>Sougnez, Carrie</author><author>Ambrogio, Lauren</author><author>Nickerson, Elizabeth</author><author>Shefler, Erica</author><author>Cortés, Maria L</author><author>Auclair, Daniel</author><author>Saksena, Gordon</author><author>Voet, Douglas</author><author>Noble, Michael</author><author>DiCara, Daniel</author><author>Lin, Pei</author><author>Lichtenstein, Lee</author><author>Heiman, David I</author><author>Fennell, Timothy</author><author>Imielinski, Marcin</author><author>Hernandez, Bryan</author><author>Hodis, Eran</author><author>Baca, Sylvan</author><author>Dulak, Austin M</author><author>Lohr, Jens</author><author>Landau, Dan-Avi</author><author>Wu, Catherine J</author><author>Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge</author><author>Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo</author><author>Koren, Amnon</author><author>McCarroll, Steven A</author><author>Mora, Jaume</author><author>Crompton, Brian</author><author>Onofrio, Robert</author><author>Parkin, Melissa</author><author>Winckler, Wendy</author><author>Ardlie, Kristin</author><author>Gabriel, Stacey B</author><author>Roberts, Charles W M</author><author>Biegel, Jaclyn A</author><author>Stegmaier, Kimberly</author><author>Bass, Adam J</author><author>Garraway, Levi A</author><author>Meyerson, Matthew</author><author>Golub, Todd R</author><author>Gordenin, Dmitry A</author><author>Sunyaev, Shamil</author><author>Lander, Eric S</author><author>Getz, Gad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutational heterogeneity in cancer and the search for new cancer-associated genes.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>214-218</pages><volume>499</volume><issue>7457</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23770567</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature12213</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Lawrence et al. - Nature - Mutational heterogeneity in cancer and the search for new cancer-associated genes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23770567</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3919509</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer. These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sims, David</author><author>Sudbery, Ian</author><author>Ilott, Nicholas E</author><author>Heger, Andreas</author><author>Ponting, Chris P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sequencing depth and coverage: key considerations in genomic analyses.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

However, sequencing costs often set limits to the amount of sequences that can be generated and, consequently, the biological outcomes that can be achieved from an experimental design. In this Review, we discuss the issue of sequencing depth in the design of next-generation sequencing experiments. We review current guidelines and precedents on the issue of coverage, as well as their underlying considerations, for four major study designs, which include de novo genome sequencing, genome resequencing, transcriptome sequencing and genomic location analyses (for example, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and chromosome conformation capture (3C)).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, Andreas</author><author>Forne, Ignasi</author><author>Imhof, Axel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bioinformatic analysis of proteomics data.</title><secondary-title>BMC systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>S3</pages><volume>8 Suppl 2</volume><issue>Suppl 2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25033288</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1752-0509-8-S2-S3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Schmidt, Forne, Imhof - BMC systems biology - Bioinformatic analysis of proteomics data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.proteomeexchange.org</url><url>http://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-8-S2-S3</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25033288</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4108846</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Most biochemical reactions in a cell are regulated by highly specialized proteins, which are the prime mediators of the cellular phenotype. Therefore the identification, quantitation and characterization of all proteins in a cell are of utmost importance to understand the molecular processes that mediate cellular physiology. With the advent of robust and reliable mass spectrometers that are able to analyze complex protein mixtures within a reasonable timeframe, the systematic analysis of all proteins in a cell becomes feasible. Besides the ongoing improvements of analytical hardware, standardized methods to analyze and study all proteins have to be developed that allow the generation of testable new hypothesis based on the enormous pre-existing amount of biological information.

Complement acts as a rapid and efficient immune surveillance system that has distinct effects on healthy and altered host cells and foreign intruders. By eliminating cellular debris and infectious microbes, orchestrating immune responses and sending 'danger' signals, complement contributes substantially to homeostasis, but it can also take action against healthy cells if not properly controlled. This review describes our updated view of the function, structure and dynamics of the complement network, highlights its interconnection with immunity at large and with other endogenous pathways, and illustrates its multiple roles in homeostasis and disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Afshar-Kharghan, Vahid</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of the complement system in cancer.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of clinical investigation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of clinical investigation</full-title></periodical><pages>780-789</pages><volume>127</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28248200</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1172/JCI90962</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Afshar-Kharghan - The Journal of clinical investigation - The role of the complement system in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://dm5migu4zj3pb.cloudfront.net/manuscripts/90000/90962/cache/90962.1-20170217152804-covered-253bed37ca4c1ab43d105aefdf7b5536.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28248200</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5330758</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In addition to being a component of innate immunity and an ancient defense mechanism against invading pathogens, complement activation also participates in the adaptive immune response, inflammation, hemostasis, embryogenesis, and organ repair and development. Activation of the complement system via classical, lectin, or alternative pathways generates anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and membrane attack complex (C5b-9) and opsonizes targeted cells. Complement activation end products and their receptors mediate cell-cell interactions that regulate several biological functions in the extravascular tissue. Signaling of anaphylatoxin receptors or assembly of membrane attack complex promotes cell dedifferentiation, proliferation, and migration in addition to reducing apoptosis. As a result, complement activation in the tumor microenvironment enhances tumor growth and increases metastasis. In this Review, I discuss immune and nonimmune functions of complement proteins and the tumor-promoting effect of complement activation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singh, Anurag</author><author>Sweeney, Michael F</author><author>Yu, Min</author><author>Burger, Alexa</author><author>Greninger, Patricia</author><author>Benes, Cyril</author><author>Haber, Daniel A</author><author>Settleman, Jeff</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TAK1 inhibition promotes apoptosis in KRAS-dependent colon cancers.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>639-50</pages><volume>148</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22341439</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.033</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Singh et al. - Cell - TAK1 inhibition promotes apoptosis in KRAS-dependent colon cancers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/S009286741200102X/1-s2.0-S009286741200102X-main.pdf?_tid=c7004757-5495-4f69-9175-ec88325b6325&amp;acdnat=1555384885_4836209354f5b7228dc0da61da718b03</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22341439</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articleren</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Colon cancers frequently harbor KRAS mutations, yet only a subset of KRAS mutant colon cancer cell lines are dependent upon KRAS signaling for survival. In a screen for kinases that promote survival of KRAS-dependent colon cancer cells, we found that the TAK1 kinase (MAP3K7) is required for tumor cell viability. The induction of apoptosis by RNAi-mediated depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of TAK1 is linked to its suppression of hyperactivated Wnt signaling, evident in both endogenous and genetically reconstituted cells. In APC mutant/KRAS-dependent cells, KRAS stimulates BMP-7 secretion and BMP signaling, leading to TAK1 activation and enhancement of Wnt-dependent transcription. An in vitro-derived &quot;TAK1 dependency signature&quot; is enriched in primary human colon cancers with mutations in both APC and KRAS, suggesting potential clinical utility in stratifying patient populations. Together, these findings identify TAK1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for a treatment-refractory subset of colon cancers exhibiting aberrant KRAS and Wnt pathway activation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singh, Anurag</author><author>Greninger, Patricia</author><author>Rhodes, Daniel</author><author>Koopman, Louise</author><author>Violette, Sheila</author><author>Bardeesy, Nabeel</author><author>Settleman, Jeff</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A gene expression signature associated with &quot;K-Ras addiction&quot; reveals regulators of EMT and tumor cell survival.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>489-500</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>CELLCYCLE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19477428</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccr.2009.03.022</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Singh et al. - Cancer cell - A gene expression signature associated with K-Ras addiction reveals regulators of EMT and tumor cell.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1535610809001111/1-s2.0-S1535610809001111-main.pdf?_tid=95615761-fcc4-42cb-89c4-861753a6329f&amp;acdnat=1555384828_e63223a89470f544cf73a315dcedfd46</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19477428</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articleren</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>K-ras mutations occur frequently in epithelial cancers. Using short hairpin RNAs to deplete K-Ras in lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines harboring K-ras mutations, two classes were identified-lines that do or do not require K-Ras to maintain viability. Comparing these two classes of cancer cells revealed a gene expression signature in K-Ras-dependent cells, associated with a well-differentiated epithelial phenotype, which was also seen in primary tumors. Several of these genes encode pharmacologically tractable proteins, such as Syk and Ron kinases and integrin beta6, depletion of which induces epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and apoptosis specifically in K-Ras-dependent cells. These findings indicate that epithelial differentiation and tumor cell viability are associated, and that EMT regulators in &quot;K-Ras-addicted&quot; cancers represent candidate therapeutic targets.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kanehisa, Minoru</author><author>Furumichi, Miho</author><author>Tanabe, Mao</author><author>Sato, Yoko</author><author>Morishima, Kanae</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KEGG: new perspectives on genomes, pathways, diseases and drugs.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D353-D361</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>D1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>27899662</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkw1092</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Kanehisa et al. - Nucleic acids research - KEGG new perspectives on genomes, pathways, diseases and drugs.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.kegg.jp/blastkoala/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899662</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5210567</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>KEGG (http://www.kegg.jp/ or http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is an encyclopedia of genes and genomes. Assigning functional meanings to genes and genomes both at the molecular and higher levels is the primary objective of the KEGG database project. Molecular-level functions are stored in the KO (KEGG Orthology) database, where each KO is defined as a functional ortholog of genes and proteins. Higher-level functions are represented by networks of molecular interactions, reactions and relations in the forms of KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules. In the past the KO database was developed for the purpose of defining nodes of molecular networks, but now the content has been expanded and the quality improved irrespective of whether or not the KOs appear in the three molecular network databases. The newly introduced addendum category of the GENES database is a collection of individual proteins whose functions are experimentally characterized and from which an increasing number of KOs are defined. Furthermore, the DISEASE and DRUG databases have been improved by systematic analysis of drug labels for better integration of diseases and drugs with the KEGG molecular networks. KEGG is moving towards becoming a comprehensive knowledge base for both functional interpretation and practical application of genomic information.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ngo, Vu N</author><author>Davis, R Eric</author><author>Lamy, Laurence</author><author>Yu, Xin</author><author>Zhao, Hong</author><author>Lenz, Georg</author><author>Lam, Lloyd T</author><author>Dave, Sandeep</author><author>Yang, Liming</author><author>Powell, John</author><author>Staudt, Louis M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A loss-of-function RNA interference screen for molecular targets in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>106-10</pages><volume>441</volume><issue>7089</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16572121</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature04687</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2006 - Ngo et al. - Nature - A loss-of-function RNA interference screen for molecular targets in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04687.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16572121</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The pursuit of novel therapeutic agents in cancer relies on the identification and validation of molecular targets. Hallmarks of cancer include self-sufficiency in growth signals and evasion from apoptosis; genes that regulate these processes may be optimal for therapeutic attack. Here we describe a loss-of-function screen for genes required for the proliferation and survival of cancer cells using an RNA interference library. We used a doxycycline-inducible retroviral vector for the expression of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to construct a library targeting 2,500 human genes. We used retroviral pools from this library to infect cell lines representing two distinct molecular subgroups of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), termed activated B-cell-like DLBCL and germinal centre B-cell-like DLBCL. Each vector was engineered to contain a unique 60-base-pair 'bar code', allowing the abundance of an individual shRNA vector within a population of transduced cells to be measured using microarrays of the bar-code sequences. We observed that a subset of shRNA vectors was depleted from the transduced cells after three weeks in culture only if shRNA expression was induced. In activated B-cell-like DLBCL cells, but not germinal centre B-cell-like DLBCL cells, shRNAs targeting the NF-kappaB pathway were depleted, in keeping with the essential role of this pathway in the survival of activated B-cell-like DLBCL. This screen uncovered CARD11 as a key upstream signalling component responsible for the constitutive IkappaB kinase activity in activated B-cell-like DLBCL. The methodology that we describe can be used to establish a functional taxonomy of cancer and help reveal new classes of therapeutic targets distinct from known oncogenes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kaelin, William G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The concept of synthetic lethality in the context of anticancer therapy.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

So, targeting a gene that is synthetic lethal to a cancer-relevant mutation should kill only cancer cells and spare normal cells. Synthetic lethality therefore provides a conceptual framework for the development of cancer-specific cytotoxic agents. This paradigm has not been exploited in the past because there were no robust methods for systematically identifying synthetic lethal genes. This is changing as a result of the increased availability of chemical and genetic tools for perturbing gene function in somatic cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McLornan, Donal P.</author><author>List, Alan</author><author>Mufti, Ghulam J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Applying synthetic lethality for the selective targeting of cancer.</title><secondary-title>The New England journal of medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The New England journal of medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1725-35</pages><volume>371</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25354106</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMra1407390</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - McLornan, List, Mufti - The New England journal of medicine - Applying synthetic lethality for the selective targeting of cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra1407390?articleTools</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25354106</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Synthetic lethality refers to the requirement that two defects be present for cell death to occur.

Lung cancer comprises several disease groups with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for ~ 85% of cases and lung adenocarcinoma being its most frequent histological subtype. Mutations in Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS) affect ~ 30% of lung adenocarcinomas but unlike other commonly altered proteins (EGFR and ALK, affected in ~ 14% and 7% of cases respec- tively), mutant KRAS remains untargetable. Therapeutic strategies that rely instead on the inhibition of mutant KRAS functional output or the targeting of mutant KRAS cellular dependencies (i.e. synthetic lethality) are an appealing alternative approach. Recent studies focused on the metabolic properties of mutant KRAS lung tumours have uncovered unique metabolic features that can potentially be exploited therapeutically. We review these findings here with a particular focus on in vivo, physiologic, mutant KRAS activity.

In this study, we have explored the possibility of exploiting inherent differences in KRAS-mutant cell metabolism for treatment. This study identified a greater dependency on folate metabolism pathways in KRAS mutant compared with KRAS wild-type NSCLC cell lines. Microarray gene expression and biologic pathway analysis identified higher expression of folate metabolism- and purine synthesis-related pathways in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells compared with wild-type counterparts. Moreover, pathway analysis and knockdown studies suggest a role for MYC transcriptional activity in the expression of these pathways in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells. Furthermore, KRAS knockdown and overexpression studies demonstrated the ability of KRAS to regulate expression of genes that comprise folate metabolism pathways. Proliferation studies demonstrated higher responsiveness to methotrexate, pemetrexed, and other antifolates in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells. Surprisingly, KRAS gene expression is downregulated in KRAS wild-type and KRAS-mutant cells by antifolates, which may also contribute to higher efficacy of antifolates in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells. In vivo analysis of multiple tumorgraft models in nude mice identified a KRAS-mutant tumor among the pemetrexed-responsive tumors and also demonstrated an association between expression of the folate pathway gene, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2), and antifolate activity. Collectively, we identify altered regulation of folate metabolism in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells that may account for higher antifolate activity in this subtype of NSCLC.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jing</author><author>Vasaikar, Suhas</author><author>Shi, Zhiao</author><author>Greer, Michael</author><author>Zhang, Bing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>WebGestalt 2017: a more comprehensive, powerful, flexible and interactive gene set enrichment analysis toolkit.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>W130-W137</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>W1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28472511</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkx356</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Wang et al. - Nucleic acids research - WebGestalt 2017 a more comprehensive, powerful, flexible and interactive gene set enrichme.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://software.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28472511</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5570149</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Functional enrichment analysis has played a key role in the biological interpretation of high-throughput omics data. As a long-standing and widely used web application for functional enrichment analysis, WebGestalt has been constantly updated to satisfy the needs of biologists from different research areas. WebGestalt 2017 supports 12 organisms, 324 gene identifiers from various databases and technology platforms, and 150 937 functional categories from public databases and computational analyses. Omics data with gene identifiers not supported by WebGestalt and functional categories not included in the WebGestalt database can also be uploaded for enrichment analysis. In addition to the Over-Representation Analysis in the previous versions, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Network Topology-based Analysis have been added to WebGestalt 2017, providing complementary approaches to the interpretation of high-throughput omics data. The new user-friendly output interface and the GOView tool allow interactive and efficient exploration and comparison of enrichment results.

Moreover, they are largely ineffective in NRAS- and NF1-mutant tumors. Here we report that genetic and chemical suppression of HDAC3 potently cooperates with MAPK pathway inhibitors in all three RAS pathway-driven tumors. Specifically, we show that entinostat dramatically enhances tumor regression when combined with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, in both models that are sensitive or relatively resistant to these agents. Interestingly, MGMT expression predicts responsiveness and marks tumors with latent defects in DNA repair. BRAF/MEK inhibitors enhance these defects by suppressing homologous recombination genes, inducing a BRCA-like state; however, addition of entinostat triggers the concomitant suppression of nonhomologous end-joining genes, resulting in a chemical synthetic lethality caused by excessive DNA damage. Together, these studies identify melanomas with latent DNA repair defects, describe a promising drug combination that capitalizes on these defects, and reveal a tractable therapeutic biomarker. SIGNIFICANCE: BRAF/MEK inhibitors are not typically curative in BRAF-mutant melanomas and are ineffective in NRAS- and NF1-mutant tumors. We show that HDAC inhibitors dramatically enhance the efficacy of BRAF/MEK inhibitors in sensitive and insensitive RAS pathway-driven melanomas by coordinately suppressing two DNA repair pathways, and identify a clinical biomarker that predicts responsiveness.See related commentary by Lombard et al., p. 469.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 453.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kriegeskorte, Nikolaus</author><author>Golan, Tal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neural network models and deep learning</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30939301</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.034</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Kriegeskorte, Golan - Unknown - Neural network models and deep learning.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0960-9822%2819%2930204-0</url><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04704</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Originally inspired by neurobiology, deep neural network models have become a powerful tool of machine learning and artificial intelligence, where they are used to approximate functions and dynamics by learning from examples.

Its requirement for complete RAS-MAPK activation and its role as a negative regulator of JAK-STAT signaling have established SHP2 as an essential player in oncogenic signaling pathways1-7. Recently, a novel potent allosteric SHP2 inhibitor was presented as a viable therapeutic option for receptor tyrosine kinase-driven cancers, but was shown to be ineffective in KRAS-mutant tumor cell lines in vitro8. Here, we report a central and indispensable role for SHP2 in oncogenic KRAS-driven tumors. Genetic deletion of Ptpn11 profoundly inhibited tumor development in mutant KRAS-driven murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. We provide evidence for a critical dependence of mutant KRAS on SHP2 during carcinogenesis. Deletion or inhibition of SHP2 in established tumors delayed tumor progression but was not sufficient to achieve tumor regression. However, SHP2 was necessary for resistance mechanisms upon blockade of MEK. Synergy was observed when both SHP2 and MEK were targeted, resulting in sustained tumor growth control in murine and human patient-derived organoids and xenograft models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. Our data indicate the clinical utility of dual SHP2/MEK inhibition as a targeted therapy approach for KRAS-mutant cancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kazi, Aslamuzzaman</author><author>Xiang, Shengyan</author><author>Yang, Hua</author><author>Delitto, Daniel</author><author>Trevino, José</author><author>Jiang, Rays H Y</author><author>Ayaz, Muhammad</author><author>Lawrence, Harshani R</author><author>Kennedy, Perry</author><author>Sebti, Saïd M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GSK3 suppression upregulates β-catenin and c-Myc to abrogate KRas-dependent tumors.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>5154</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30514931</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-018-07644-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Kazi et al. - Nature communications - GSK3 suppression upregulates β-catenin and c-Myc to abrogate KRas-dependent tumors.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/naturecommunications</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30514931</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6279809</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mutant KRas is a significant driver of human oncogenesis and confers resistance to therapy, underscoring the need to develop approaches that disable mutant KRas-driven tumors. Because targeting KRas directly has proven difficult, identifying vulnerabilities specific for mutant KRas tumors is an important alternative approach. Here we show that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is required for the in vitro and in vivo growth and survival of human mutant KRas-dependent tumors but is dispensable for mutant KRas-independent tumors. Further, inhibiting phosphorylation of GSK3 substrates c-Myc on T58 and β-catenin on S33/S37/T41 and their subsequent upregulation contribute to the antitumor activity of GSK3 inhibition. Importantly, GSK3 blockade inhibits the in vivo growth of G12D, G12V, and G12C mutant KRas primary and metastatic patient-derived xenografts from pancreatic cancer patients who progressed on chemo- and radiation therapies.

Despite efforts to develop KRAS-targeted drugs, the absolute dependence of PDAC cells on KRAS remains incompletely understood. Here we model complete KRAS inhibition using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing and demonstrate that KRAS is dispensable in a subset of human and mouse PDAC cells. Remarkably, nearly all KRAS deficient cells exhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and induced sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors. Furthermore, comparison of gene expression profiles of PDAC cells retaining or lacking KRAS reveal a role of KRAS in the suppression of metastasis-related genes. Collectively, these data underscore the potential for PDAC resistance to even the very best KRAS inhibitors and provide insights into mechanisms of response and resistance to KRAS inhibition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zeitouni, Daniel</author><author>Pylayeva-Gupta, Yuliya</author><author>Der, Channing J.</author><author>Bryant, Kirsten L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KRAS Mutant Pancreatic Cancer: No Lone Path to an Effective Treatment.</title><secondary-title>Cancers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancers</full-title></periodical><pages>1-22</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>RAS</keyword><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>pancreatic</keyword><keyword>therapeutics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27096871</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/cancers8040045</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Zeitouni et al. - Cancers - KRAS Mutant Pancreatic Cancer No Lone Path to an Effective Treatment.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27096871</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4846854</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with a dismal 7% 5-year survival rate and is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2020. KRAS is mutated in 95% of PDACs and is a well-validated driver of PDAC growth and maintenance. However, despite comprehensive efforts, an effective anti-RAS drug has yet to reach the clinic. Different paths to inhibiting RAS signaling are currently under investigation in the hope of finding a successful treatment. Recently, direct RAS binding molecules have been discovered, challenging the perception that RAS is an &quot;undruggable&quot; protein. Other strategies currently being pursued take an indirect approach, targeting proteins that facilitate RAS membrane association or downstream effector signaling. Unbiased genetic screens have identified synthetic lethal interactors of mutant RAS. Most recently, metabolic targets in pathways related to glycolytic signaling, glutamine utilization, autophagy, and macropinocytosis are also being explored. Harnessing the patient's immune system to fight their cancer is an additional exciting route that is being considered. The &quot;best&quot; path to inhibiting KRAS has yet to be determined, with each having promise as well as potential pitfalls. We will summarize the state-of-the-art for each direction, focusing on efforts directed toward the development of therapeutics for pancreatic cancer patients with mutated KRAS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Chen-Hao</author><author>Xiao, Tengfei</author><author>Xu, Han</author><author>Jiang, Peng</author><author>Meyer, Clifford A</author><author>Li, Wei</author><author>Brown, Myles</author><author>Liu, X Shirley</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improved design and analysis of CRISPR knockout screens.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>4095-4101</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29868757</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bty450</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Chen et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Improved design and analysis of CRISPR knockout screens.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/34/23/4095/5026664</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29868757</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6247926</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation Genome-wide clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 screen has been widely used to interrogate gene functions. However, the rules to design better libraries beg further refinement. Results We found single guide RNA (sgRNA) outliers are characterized by higher G-nucleotide counts, especially in regions distal from the PAM motif and are associated with stronger off-target activities. Furthermore, using non-targeting sgRNAs as negative controls lead to strong bias, which can be mitigated by using sgRNAs targeting multiple 'safe harbor' regions. Custom-designed screens confirmed our findings and further revealed that 19 nt sgRNAs consistently gave the best signal-to-noise ratio. Collectively, our analysis motivated the design of a new genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen library and uncovered some intriguing properties of the CRISPR-Cas9 system.

Histones, the fundamental substrates for chromatin-modifying and remodelling enzymes, are mutated in tumours including gliomas, sarcomas, head and neck cancers, and carcinosarcomas. Classical 'oncohistone' mutations occur in the N-terminal tail of histone H3 and affect the function of polycomb repressor complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). However, the prevalence and function of histone mutations in other tumour contexts is unknown. Here we show that somatic histone mutations occur in approximately 4% (at a conservative estimate) of diverse tumour types and in crucial regions of histone proteins. Mutations occur in all four core histones, in both the N-terminal tails and globular histone fold domains, and at or near residues that contain important post-translational modifications. Many globular domain mutations are homologous to yeast mutants that abrogate the need for SWI/SNF function, occur in the key regulatory 'acidic patch' of histones H2A and H2B, or are predicted to disrupt the H2B-H4 interface. The histone mutation dataset and the hypotheses presented here on the effect of the mutations on important chromatin functions should serve as a resource and starting point for the chromatin and cancer biology fields in exploring an expanding role of histone mutations in cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wassef, Michel</author><author>Luscan, Armelle</author><author>Aflaki, Setareh</author><author>Zielinski, Dina</author><author>Jansen, Pascal W T C</author><author>Baymaz, H.

In malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a crucial role in gene silencing, is inactivated through recurrent mutations in core subunits embryonic ectoderm development (EED) and suppressor of zeste 12 homolog (SUZ12), but mutations in PRC2's main catalytic subunit enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) have never been found. This is in contrast to myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, which harbor frequent loss-of-function mutations in EZH2. Here, we investigated whether the absence of EZH2 mutations in MPNST is due to a PRC2-independent (i.e., noncanonical) function of the enzyme or to redundancy with EZH1. We show that, in the absence of SUZ12, EZH2 remains bound to EED but loses its interaction with all other core and accessory PRC2 subunits. Through genetic and pharmacological analyses, we unambiguously establish that EZH2 is functionally inert in this context, thereby excluding a PRC2-independent function. Instead, we show that EZH1 and EZH2 are functionally redundant in the slowly proliferating MPNST precursors. We provide evidence that the compensatory function of EZH1 is alleviated upon higher proliferation. This work reveals how context-dependent redundancies can shape tumor-type specific mutation patterns in chromatin regulators.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jang, Hyo Sik</author><author>Shah, Nakul M</author><author>Du, Alan Y.</author><author>Dailey, Zea Z.</author><author>Pehrsson, Erica C.</author><author>Godoy, Paula M.</author><author>Zhang, David</author><author>Li, Daofeng</author><author>Xing, Xiaoyun</author><author>Kim, Sungsu</author><author>O’Donnell, David</author><author>Gordon, Jeffrey I.</author><author>Wang, Ting</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transposable elements drive widespread expression of oncogenes in human cancers</title><secondary-title>Nature Genetics 2019 51:4</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Genetics 2019 51:4</full-title></periodical><pages>611</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Epigenetics</keyword><keyword>Gene regulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>4158801903733</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41588-019-0373-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Jang et al. - Nature Genetics 2019 514 - Transposable elements drive widespread expression of oncogenes in human cancers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-019-0373-3</url><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0373-3</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Transposable elements (TEs) are an abundant and rich genetic resource of regulatory sequences1–3. Cryptic regulatory elements within TEs can be epigenetically reactivated in cancer to influence oncogenesis in a process termed onco-exaptation4. However, the prevalence and impact of TE onco-exaptation events across cancer types are poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed 7,769 tumors and 625 normal datasets from 15 cancer types, identifying 129 TE cryptic promoter-activation events involving 106 oncogenes across 3,864 tumors. Furthermore, we interrogated the AluJb-LIN28B candidate: the genetic deletion of the TE eliminated oncogene expression, while dynamic DNA methylation modulated promoter activity, illustrating the necessity and sufficiency of a TE for oncogene activation. Collectively, our results characterize the global profile of TE onco-exaptation and highlight this prevalent phenomenon as an important mechanism for promiscuous oncogene activation and ultimately tumorigenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ezponda, Teresa</author><author>Licht, Jonathan D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular pathways: deregulation of histone h3 lysine 27 methylation in cancer-different paths, same destination.</title><secondary-title>Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>5001-8</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24987060</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2499</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Ezponda, Licht - Clinical cancer research an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research - Molecular pathwa.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.aacrjournals.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24987060</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4184969</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me), a modification associated with gene repression, plays a critical role in regulating the expression of genes that determine the balance between cell differentiation and proliferation. Alteration of the level of this histone modification has emerged as a recurrent theme in many types of cancer, demonstrating that either excess or lack of H3K27 methylation can have oncogenic effects. Cancer genome sequencing has revealed the genetic basis of H3K27me deregulation, including mutations of the components of the H3K27 methyltransferase complex PRC2 and accessory proteins, and deletions and inactivating mutations of the H3K27 demethylase UTX in a wide variety of neoplasms. More recently, mutations of lysine 27 on histone H3 itself were shown to prevent H3K27me in pediatric glioblastomas. Aberrant expression or mutations in proteins that recognize H3K27me3 also occur in cancer and may result in misinterpretation of this mark. In addition, due to the cross-talk between different epigenetic modifications, alterations of chromatin modifiers controlling H3K36me, or even mutations of this residue, can ultimately regulate H3K27me levels and distribution across the genome. The significance of mutations altering H3K27me is underscored by the fact that many tumors harboring such lesions often have a poor clinical outcome. New therapeutic approaches targeting aberrant H3K27 methylation include small molecules that block the action of mutant EZH2 in germinal center-derived lymphoma. Understanding the biologic consequences and gene expression pathways affected by aberrant H3K27 methylation may also lead to other new therapeutic strategies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koppens, M</author><author>van Lohuizen, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Context-dependent actions of Polycomb repressors in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Oncogene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncogene</full-title></periodical><pages>1341-52</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26050622</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/onc.2015.195</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Koppens, van Lohuizen - Oncogene - Context-dependent actions of Polycomb repressors in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/onc</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/onc2015195</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26050622</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins form Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs) that function as epigenetic repressors of gene expression. The large variety of PcG proteins, in addition to the high number of paralogs, allows for the formation of diverse PRCs with different properties, providing fine-tuned control over cell specification. Initially identified as being oncogenes, a small number of PcG genes are involved in tumor development in part through the repression of the CDKN2A locus. Therefore, enhanced PcG-mediated repression has long been assumed to be cancer promoting. However, recent data have revealed that for some cancers, PcG proteins act as tumor suppressors, indicating that this traditional view is oversimplified. In this review, we present an overview of the roles of PcG genes in oncogenesis and how the nature of their role is context dependent.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jain, Payal</author><author>Di Croce, Luciano</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutations and deletions of PRC2 in prostate cancer.</title><secondary-title>BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology</full-title></periodical><pages>446-54</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>PRC2</keyword><keyword>Polycomb proteins</keyword><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>epigenetic modifications</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27000413</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/bies.201500162</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Jain, Di Croce - BioEssays news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology - Mutations and deletions of PRC2 i.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27000413</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Polycomb group of proteins (PcGs) are transcriptional repressor complexes that regulate important biological processes and play critical roles in cancer. Mutating or deleting EZH2 can have both oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions by increasing or decreasing H3K27me3. In contrast, mutations of SUZ12 and EED are reported to have tumor suppressive functions. EZH2 is overexpressed in many cancers, including prostate cancer, which can lead to silencing of tumor suppressors, genes regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and interferon signaling. In some cases, EZH2 overexpression also leads to its use of non-histone substrates. Lastly, PRC2 associated factors can influence the progression of cancer through progressive mutations or by specific binding to certain target genes. Here, we discuss which mutations and deletions of the PRC2 complex have been detected in different cancers, with a specific focus on the overexpression of EZH2 in prostate cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laugesen, Anne</author><author>Højfeldt, Jonas Westergaard</author><author>Helin, Kristian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) in Transcriptional Regulation and Cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine</full-title></periodical><volume>6</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27449971</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/cshperspect.a026575</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Laugesen, Højfeldt, Helin - Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine - Role of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) in Tr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449971</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5008062</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The chromatin environment is modulated by a machinery of chromatin modifiers, required for the specification and maintenance of cell fate.

Inactivating mutations of the catalytic component of PRC2, EZH2, are seen in myeloid disorders. We reasoned that the other 2 core PRC2 components, SUZ12 and EED, may also be mutational targets in these diseases, as well as associated factors such as JARID2. SUZ12 mutations were identified in 1 of 2 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasms with 17q acquired uniparental disomy and in 2 of 2 myelofibrosis cases with focal 17q11 deletions. All 3 were missense mutations affecting the highly conserved VEFS domain. Analysis of a further 146 myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm patients revealed an additional VEFS domain mutant, yielding a total mutation frequency of 1.4% (2 of 148). We did not find mutations of JARID2 or EED in association with acquired uniparental disomy for chromosome 6p or 11q, respectively; however, screening unselected cases identified missense mutations in EED (1 of 148; 1%) and JARID2 (3 of 148; 2%). All 3 SUZ12 mutations tested and the EED mutation reduced PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity in vitro, demonstrating that PRC2 function may be compromised in myeloid disorders by mutation of distinct genes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blackledge, Neil P</author><author>Rose, Nathan R</author><author>Klose, Robert J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Targeting Polycomb systems to regulate gene expression: modifications to a complex story.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

Other histone modifications are also important for PRC2 binding as PRC2 can respond to different cellular states via crosstalk between histone modifications. Additionally, PRC2 might be able to sense the transcriptional status of genes by binding to nascent RNA, which could also guide the complex to chromatin. In this review, we will discuss how all these molecular aspects define a local chromatin state which controls accurate, cell-type-specific epigenetic silencing by PRC2.

Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human PRC2 in a basal state and two distinct active states while in complex with its cofactors JARID2 and AEBP2. Both cofactors mimic the binding of histone H3 tails. JARID2, methylated by PRC2, mimics a methylated H3 tail to stimulate PRC2 activity, whereas AEBP2 interacts with the RBAP48 subunit, mimicking an unmodified H3 tail. SUZ12 interacts with all other subunits within the assembly and thus contributes to the stability of the complex. Our analysis defines the complete architecture of a functionally relevant PRC2 and provides a structural framework to understand its regulation by cofactors, histone tails, and RNA.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holoch, Daniel</author><author>Margueron, Raphaël</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms Regulating PRC2 Recruitment and Enzymatic Activity.</title><secondary-title>Trends in biochemical sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in biochemical sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>531-542</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>H3K27me3</keyword><keyword>PRC1</keyword><keyword>PRC2</keyword><keyword>PRC2 facultative subunits</keyword><keyword>PRC2 regulation</keyword><keyword>transcriptional repression</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>0968-0004 (Print) 0968-0004</isbn><accession-num>28483375</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tibs.2017.04.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Holoch, Margueron - Trends in biochemical sciences - Mechanisms Regulating PRC2 Recruitment and Enzymatic Activity.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2017.04.003531</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28483375</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and its histone H3 lysine-27 methylation activity are crucial for multicellular development by virtue of their role in maintaining transcriptional repression patterns. The recruitment and enzymatic activity of PRC2 are controlled by a series of intricate mechanisms whose molecular details have been emerging at a rapid pace.

One way to tackle this problem is to incorporate the fact that genes act together in functional modules. The connectivity knowledge present in existing protein-protein interaction networks together with mutation frequencies of genes and the mutual exclusivity of cancer mutations can be utilized to increase the accuracy of identifying cancer driver modules. Results: We present a novel edge-weighted random walk-based approach that incorporates connectivity information in the form of protein-protein interactions, mutual exclusion, and coverage to identify cancer driver modules. MEXCOWalk outperforms several state-of-the-art computational methods on TCGA pancancer data in terms of recovering known cancer genes, providing modules that are capable of classifying normal and tumor samples, and that are enriched for mutations in specific cancer types. Furthermore, the risk scores determined with output modules can stratify patients into low-risk and high-risk groups in multiple cancer types. MEXCOwalk identifies modules containing both well-known cancer genes and putative cancer genes that are rarely mutated in the pan-cancer data.

However, previous studies have reported that a gene-independent antiproliferative effect of Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage confounds such measurement of genetic dependency, thereby leading to false-positive results in copy number-amplified regions. We developed CERES, a computational method to estimate gene-dependency levels from CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens while accounting for the copy number-specific effect. In our efforts to define a cancer dependency map, we performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens across 342 cancer cell lines and applied CERES to this data set. We found that CERES decreased false-positive results and estimated sgRNA activity for both this data set and previously published screens performed with different sgRNA libraries. We further demonstrate the utility of this collection of screens, after CERES correction, for identifying cancer-type-specific vulnerabilities.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reyes, José</author><author>Chen, Jia-Yun</author><author>Stewart-Ornstein, Jacob</author><author>Karhohs, Kyle W</author><author>Mock, Caroline S</author><author>Lahav, Galit</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fluctuations in p53 Signaling Allow Escape from Cell-Cycle Arrest.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cell</full-title></periodical><pages>581-591.e5</pages><volume>71</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>DNA damage</keyword><keyword>cell-cycle arrest</keyword><keyword>heterogeneity</keyword><keyword>live-cell imaging</keyword><keyword>p53</keyword><keyword>signaling dynamics</keyword><keyword>single cells</keyword><keyword>systems biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30057196</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molcel.2018.06.031</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Reyes et al. - Molecular cell - Fluctuations in p53 Signaling Allow Escape from Cell-Cycle Arrest.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.06.031</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30057196</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6282757</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Biological signals need to be robust and filter small fluctuations yet maintain sensitivity to signals across a wide range of magnitudes. Here, we studied how fluctuations in DNA damage signaling relate to maintenance of long-term cell-cycle arrest. Using live-cell imaging, we quantified division profiles of individual human cells in the course of 1 week after irradiation. We found a subset of cells that initially establish cell-cycle arrest and then sporadically escape and divide. Using fluorescent reporters and mathematical modeling, we determined that fluctuations in the oscillatory pattern of the tumor suppressor p53 trigger a sharp switch between p21 and CDK2, leading to escape from arrest. Transient perturbation of p53 stability mimicked the noise in individual cells and was sufficient to trigger escape from arrest. Our results show that the self-reinforcing circuitry that mediates cell-cycle transitions can translate small fluctuations in p53 signaling into large phenotypic changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gonzalez-Perez, Abel</author><author>Sabarinathan, Radhakrishnan</author><author>Lopez-Bigas, Nuria</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Local Determinants of the Mutational Landscape of the Human Genome.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>101-114</pages><volume>177</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30901533</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.051</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Gonzalez-Perez, Sabarinathan, Lopez-Bigas - Cell - Local Determinants of the Mutational Landscape of the Human Genome.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.051</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S009286741930234X</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901533</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Large-scale chromatin features, such as replication time and accessibility influence the rate of somatic and germline mutations at the megabase scale.

An important application of such tests is the detection of differentially expressed genes between two patient populations, as shifts in expression levels are expected to be coherent with the structure of graphs reflecting gene properties such as biological process, molecular function, regulation or metabolism. For a fixed graph of interest, we demonstrate that accounting for graph structure can yield more powerful tests under the assumption of smooth distribution shift on the graph. We also investigate the identification of nonhomogeneous subgraphs of a given large graph, which poses both computational and multiple hypothesis testing problems. The relevance and benefits of the proposed approach are illustrated on synthetic data and on breast and bladder cancer gene expression data analyzed in the context of KEGG and NCI pathways.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dao, Phuong</author><author>Kim, Yoo-Ah</author><author>Wojtowicz, Damian</author><author>Madan, Sanna</author><author>Sharan, Roded</author><author>Przytycka, Teresa M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>BeWith: A Between-Within method to discover relationships between cancer modules via integrated analysis of mutual exclusivity, co-occurrence and functional interactions.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1005695</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>29023534</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005695</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Dao et al. - PLoS computational biology - BeWith A Between-Within method to discover relationships between cancer modules via int.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005695</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29023534</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5638227</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The analysis of the mutational landscape of cancer, including mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations, has been instrumental in studying the disease. We hypothesized that exploring the interplay between co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and functional interactions between genes will further improve our understanding of the disease and help to uncover new relations between cancer driving genes and pathways. To this end, we designed a general framework, BeWith, for identifying modules with different combinations of mutation and interaction patterns. We focused on three different settings of the BeWith schema: (i) BeME-WithFun, in which the relations between modules are enriched with mutual exclusivity, while genes within each module are functionally related; (ii) BeME-WithCo, which combines mutual exclusivity between modules with co-occurrence within modules; and (iii) BeCo-WithMEFun, which ensures co-occurrence between modules, while the within module relations combine mutual exclusivity and functional interactions. We formulated the BeWith framework using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling us to find optimally scoring sets of modules. Our results demonstrate the utility of BeWith in providing novel information about mutational patterns, driver genes, and pathways. In particular, BeME-WithFun helped identify functionally coherent modules that might be relevant for cancer progression. In addition to finding previously well-known drivers, the identified modules pointed to other novel findings such as the interaction between NCOR2 and NCOA3 in breast cancer. Additionally, an application of the BeME-WithCo setting revealed that gene groups differ with respect to their vulnerability to different mutagenic processes, and helped us to uncover pairs of genes with potentially synergistic effects, including a potential synergy between mutations in TP53 and the metastasis related DCC gene. Overall, BeWith not only helped us uncover relations between potential driver genes and pathways, but also provided additional insights on patterns of the mutational landscape, going beyond cancer driving mutations.

Because the computational part of data analysis ultimately identifies shape characteristics in the organization of data sets, the mathematics of shape recognition in high dimensions continues to be a crucial part of data analysis. This article introduces a method that extracts information from high-throughput microarray data and, by using topology, provides greater depth of information than current analytic techniques. The method, termed Progression Analysis of Disease (PAD), first identifies robust aspects of cluster analysis, then goes deeper to find a multitude of biologically meaningful shape characteristics in these data. Additionally, because PAD incorporates a visualization tool, it provides a simple picture or graph that can be used to further explore these data. Although PAD can be applied to a wide range of high-throughput data types, it is used here as an example to analyze breast cancer transcriptional data. This identified a unique subgroup of Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancers that express high levels of c-MYB and low levels of innate inflammatory genes. These patients exhibit 100% survival and no metastasis. No supervised step beyond distinction between tumor and healthy patients was used to identify this subtype. The group has a clear and distinct, statistically significant molecular signature, it highlights coherent biology but is invisible to cluster methods, and does not fit into the accepted classification of Luminal A/B, Normal-like subtypes of ER(+) breast cancers. We denote the group as c-MYB(+) breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lum, P Y</author><author>Singh, G</author><author>Lehman, A</author><author>Ishkanov, T</author><author>Vejdemo-Johansson, M</author><author>Alagappan, M</author><author>Carlsson, J</author><author>Carlsson, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extracting insights from the shape of complex data using topology.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1236</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23393618</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep01236</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Lum et al. - Scientific reports - Extracting insights from the shape of complex data using topology.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1102826108</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21482760</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3084136</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23393618</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?a</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut;proj:tissuespec</label><abstract>This paper applies topological methods to study complex high dimensional data sets by extracting shapes (patterns) and obtaining insights about them. Our method combines the best features of existing standard methodologies such as principal component and cluster analyses to provide a geometric representation of complex data sets. Through this hybrid method, we often find subgroups in data sets that traditional methodologies fail to find. Our method also permits the analysis of individual data sets as well as the analysis of relationships between related data sets. We illustrate the use of our method by applying it to three very different kinds of data, namely gene expression from breast tumors, voting data from the United States House of Representatives and player performance data from the NBA, in each case finding stratifications of the data which are more refined than those produced by standard methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yuan, Tina L.</author><author>Amzallag, Arnaud</author><author>Bagni, Rachel</author><author>Yi, Ming</author><author>Afghani, Shervin</author><author>Burgan, William</author><author>Fer, Nicole</author><author>Strathern, Leslie A.</author><author>Powell, Katie</author><author>Smith, Brian</author><author>Waters, Andrew M.</author><author>Drubin, David</author><author>Thomson, Ty</author><author>Liao, Rosy</author><author>Greninger, Patricia</author><author>Stein, Giovanna T.</author><author>Murchie, Ellen</author><author>Cortez, Eliane</author><author>Egan, Regina K.</author><author>Procter, Lauren</author><author>Bess, Matthew</author><author>Cheng, Kwong Tai</author><author>Lee, Chih-Shia</author><author>Lee, Liam Changwoo</author><author>Fellmann, Christof</author><author>Stephens, Robert</author><author>Luo, Ji</author><author>Lowe, Scott W.</author><author>Benes, Cyril H.</author><author>McCormick, Frank</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential Effector Engagement by Oncogenic KRAS.</title><secondary-title>Cell reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1889-1902</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>RNAi screen</keyword><keyword>RSK</keyword><keyword>paralogs</keyword><keyword>redundancy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>ElsevierCompany.</publisher><accession-num>29444439</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.celrep.2018.01.051</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Yuan et al. - Cell reports - Differential Effector Engagement by Oncogenic KRAS.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.01.051</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29444439</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6343826</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>KRAS can bind numerous effector proteins, which activate different downstream signaling events.

We show that every cell line has a unique combination of effector dependencies, but in spite of this heterogeneity, we were able to identify two major subtypes of KRAS mutant cancers of the lung, pancreas, and large intestine, which reflect different KRAS effector engagement and opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>GTEx Consortium</author><author>Laboratory, Data Analysis &amp;Coordinating Center (LDACC)—Analysis Working Group</author><author>Statistical Methods groups—Analysis Working Group</author><author>Enhancing GTEx (eGTEx) groups</author><author>NIH Common Fund</author><author>NIH/NCI</author><author>NIH/NHGRI</author><author>NIH/NIMH</author><author>NIH/NIDA</author><author>Biospecimen Collection Source Site—NDRI</author><author>Biospecimen Collection Source Site—RPCI</author><author>Biospecimen Core Resource—VARI</author><author>Brain Bank Repository—University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank</author><author>Leidos Biomedical—Project Management</author><author>ELSI Study</author><author>Genome Browser Data Integration &amp;Visualization—EBI</author><author>Genome Browser Data Integration &amp;Visualization—UCSC Genomics Institute, University of California Santa Cruz</author><author>Lead analysts:</author><author>Laboratory, Data Analysis &amp;Coordinating Center (LDACC):</author><author>NIH program management:</author><author>Biospecimen collection:</author><author>Pathology:</author><author>eQTL manuscript working group:</author><author>Battle, Alexis</author><author>Brown, Christopher D</author><author>Engelhardt, Barbara E.</author><author>Montgomery, Stephen B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic effects on gene expression across human tissues.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>204-213</pages><volume>550</volume><issue>7675</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>0008-5472 (Print)\r0008-5472 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>29022597</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature24277</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - GTEx Consortium et al. - Nature - Genetic effects on gene expression across human tissues.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.gtexportal.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29022597</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5776756</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koschützki, Dirk</author><author>Schreiber, Falk</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Centrality analysis methods for biological networks and their application to gene regulatory networks.</title><secondary-title>Gene regulation and systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gene regulation and systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>193-201</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>centralities</keyword><keyword>escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>gene regulatory network</keyword><keyword>network analysis</keyword><keyword>network motif</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><isbn>1177-6250 (Electronic)\r1177-6250 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>19787083</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4137/GRSB.S702</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2008 - Koschützki, Schreiber - Gene regulation and systems biology - Centrality analysis methods for biological networks and their appl.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2733090/pdf/grsb-2008-193.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19787083</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2733090</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The structural analysis of biological networks includes the ranking of the vertices based on the connection structure of a network.

Beyond that, differential correlation analysis was suggested to identify changes in the correlation patterns between disease states. The detection of differential correlation is a demanding task, as the number of entries in the gene-by-gene correlation matrix is large. Currently, there is no gold standard for the detection of differential correlation and statistical validation. RESULTS We developed two untargeted algorithms (DCloc and DCglob) that identify differential correlation patterns by comparing the local or global topology of correlation networks. Construction of networks from correlation structures requires fixing of a correlation threshold. Instead of a single cutoff, the algorithms systematically investigate a series of correlation thresholds and permit to detect different kinds of correlation changes at the same level of significance: strong changes of a few genes and moderate changes of many genes. Comparing the correlation structure of 208 ER- breast carcinomas and 208 ER+ breast carcinomas, DCloc detected 770 differentially correlated genes with a FDR of 12.8%, while DCglob detected 630 differentially correlated genes with a FDR of 12.1%. In two-fold cross-validation, the reproducibility of the list of the top 5% differentially correlated genes in 140 ER- tumors and in 140 ER+ tumors was 49% for DCloc and 33% for DCglob. CONCLUSIONS We developed two correlation network topology based algorithms for the detection of differential correlations in different disease states. Clusters of differentially correlated genes could be interpreted biologically and included the marker genes hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) and acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain 1 (ACSM1) of invasive apocrine carcinomas that were differentially correlated, but not differentially expressed. Using random subsampling and cross-validation, DCloc and DCglob were shown to identify specific and reproducible lists of differentially correlated genes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>ODIBAT, OMAR</author><author>REDDY, CHANDAN K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ranking Differential Genes in Co-expression Networks</title><secondary-title>Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1240002</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>01</issue><keywords><keyword>a simple illustration of</keyword><keyword>central-</keyword><keyword>co-expression networks</keyword><keyword>connectivity</keyword><keyword>differential net-</keyword><keyword>differential network analysis</keyword><keyword>figure 1</keyword><keyword>ity</keyword><keyword>ranking</keyword><keyword>shortest paths</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>9781450307963</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1142/s0219720012400021</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - ODIBAT, REDDY - Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology - Ranking Differential Genes in Co-expression Networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cs.wayne.edu/~reddy/Papers/BCB11a.pdf</url><url>http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2147805.2147849</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Identifying the genes that change their expressions between two conditions (such as normal versus cancer) is a crucial task that can help in understanding the causes of diseases. Differential networking has emerged as a powerful approach to detect the changes in network structures and to identify the differentially connected genes among two networks. However, existing differential network-based methods primarily depend on pairwise comparisons of the genes based on their connectivity. Therefore, these methods cannot capture the essential topological changes in the network structures. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, DiffRank, which ranks the genes based on their contribution to the differences between the two networks. To achieve this goal, we define two novel structural scoring measures: a local structure measure (differential connectivity) and a global structure measure (differential betweenness centrality). These measures are optimized by propagating the scores through the network structure and then ranking the genes based on these propagated scores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffRank on synthetic and real datasets. For the synthetic datasets, we developed a simulator for generating synthetic differential scale-free networks, and we compared our method with existing methods. The comparisons show that our algorithm outperforms these existing methods. For the real datasets, we apply the proposed algorithm on several gene expression datasets and demonstrate that the proposed method provides biologically interesting results.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fuller, Tova F</author><author>Ghazalpour, Anatole</author><author>Aten, Jason E</author><author>Drake, Thomas A</author><author>Lusis, Aldons J.</author><author>Horvath, Steve</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Weighted gene coexpression network analysis strategies applied to mouse weight.</title><secondary-title>Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</full-title></periodical><pages>463-72</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>6-7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17668265</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00335-007-9043-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Fuller et al. - Mammalian genome official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society - Weighted gene coexpression net.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00335-007-9043-3.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17668265</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1998880</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Systems-oriented genetic approaches that incorporate gene expression and genotype data are valuable in the quest for genetic regulatory loci underlying complex traits. Gene coexpression network analysis lends itself to identification of entire groups of differentially regulated genes-a highly relevant endeavor in finding the underpinnings of complex traits that are, by definition, polygenic in nature. Here we describe one such approach based on liver gene expression and genotype data from an F(2) mouse inter-cross utilizing weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of gene expression data to identify physiologically relevant modules. We describe two strategies: single-network analysis and differential network analysis. Single-network analysis reveals the presence of a physiologically interesting module that can be found in two distinct mouse crosses. Module quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) that perturb this module were discovered. In addition, we report a list of genetic drivers for this module. Differential network analysis reveals differences in connectivity and module structure between two networks based on the liver expression data of lean and obese mice. Functional annotation of these genes suggests a biological pathway involving epidermal growth factor (EGF). Our results demonstrate the utility of WGCNA in identifying genetic drivers and in finding genetic pathways represented by gene modules. These examples provide evidence that integration of network properties may well help chart the path across the gene-trait chasm.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lichtblau, Yvonne</author><author>Zimmermann, Karin</author><author>Haldemann, Berit</author><author>Lenze, Dido</author><author>Hummel, Michael</author><author>Leser, Ulf</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative assessment of differential network analysis methods.</title><secondary-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>837-850</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>biomarker</keyword><keyword>differential network analysis</keyword><keyword>gene-regulatory networks</keyword><keyword>miRNAs</keyword><keyword>transcriptome data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>27473063</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bib/bbw061</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Lichtblau et al. - Briefings in bioinformatics - Comparative assessment of differential network analysis methods.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-abstract/18/5/837/2562785</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27473063</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Differential network analysis (DiNA) denotes a recent class of network-based Bioinformatics algorithms which focus on the differences in network topologies between two states of a cell, such as healthy and disease, to identify key players in the discriminating biological processes. In contrast to conventional differential analysis, DiNA identifies changes in the interplay between molecules, rather than changes in single molecules. This ability is especially important in cases where effectors are changed, e.g. mutated, but their expression is not. A number of different DiNA approaches have been proposed, yet a comparative assessment of their performance in different settings is still lacking. In this paper, we evaluate 10 different DiNA algorithms regarding their ability to recover genetic key players from transcriptome data. We construct high-quality regulatory networks and enrich them with co-expression data from four different types of cancer. Next, we assess the results of applying DiNA algorithms on these data sets using a gold standard list (GSL). We find that local DiNA algorithms are generally superior to global algorithms, and that all DiNA algorithms outperform conventional differential expression analysis. We also assess the ability of DiNA methods to exploit additional knowledge in the underlying cellular networks. To this end, we enrich the cancer-type specific networks with known regulatory miRNAs and compare the algorithms performance in networks with and without miRNA. We find that including miRNAs consistently and considerably improves the performance of almost all tested algorithms. Our results underline the advantages of comprehensive cell models for the analysis of -omics data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Class, Caleb A</author><author>Ha, Min Jin</author><author>Baladandayuthapani, Veerabhadran</author><author>Do, Kim-Anh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>iDINGO-integrative differential network analysis in genomics with Shiny application.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>1243-1245</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>13674811 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>29194470</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btx750</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Class et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - iDINGO-integrative differential network analysis in genomics with Shiny applica.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/34/7/1243/4673197</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29194470</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6030922</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation Differential network analysis is an important way to understand network rewiring involved in disease progression and development.

However, it remains unclear which are the key driver mutations or dependencies in a given cancer and how these influence pathogenesis and response to therapy. Although tumors of similar types and clinical outcomes can have patterns of mutations that are strikingly different, it is becoming apparent that these mutations recurrently hijack the same hallmark molecular pathways and networks. For this reason, it is likely that successful interpretation of cancer genomes will require comprehensive knowledge of the molecular networks under selective pressure in oncogenesis. Here we announce the creation of a new effort, The Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI), aimed at systematically detailing these complex interactions among cancer genes and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. We discuss recent progress that enables creation of these cancer cell maps across a range of tumor types and how they can be used to target networks disrupted in individual patients, significantly accelerating the development of precision medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ha, Min Jin</author><author>Baladandayuthapani, Veerabhadran</author><author>Do, Kim-Anh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DINGO: differential network analysis in genomics.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>3413-20</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26148744</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btv406</electronic-resource-num><notes>iDINGO (integrative DINGO) released in 2017</notes><research-notes>iDINGO (integrative DINGO) released in 2017</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Ha, Baladandayuthapani, Do - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - DINGO differential network analysis in genomics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/31/21/3413/195238</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26148744</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4751246</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION Cancer progression and development are initiated by aberrations in various molecular networks through coordinated changes across multiple genes and pathways. It is important to understand how these networks change under different stress conditions and/or patient-specific groups to infer differential patterns of activation and inhibition. Existing methods are limited to correlation networks that are independently estimated from separate group-specific data and without due consideration of relationships that are conserved across multiple groups. METHOD We propose a pathway-based differential network analysis in genomics (DINGO) model for estimating group-specific networks and making inference on the differential networks. DINGO jointly estimates the group-specific conditional dependencies by decomposing them into global and group-specific components. The delineation of these components allows for a more refined picture of the major driver and passenger events in the elucidation of cancer progression and development. RESULTS Simulation studies demonstrate that DINGO provides more accurate group-specific conditional dependencies than achieved by using separate estimation approaches. We apply DINGO to key signaling pathways in glioblastoma to build differential networks for long-term survivors and short-term survivors in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The hub genes found by mRNA expression, DNA copy number, methylation and microRNA expression reveal several important roles in glioblastoma progression.

Due to intensive computation, however, these methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and are limited in genome-wide analysis. We present the modulated gene/gene set interaction (MAGIC) analysis to systematically identify genome-wide modulation of interaction networks. Based on a novel statistical test employing conjugate Fisher transformations of correlation coefficients, MAGIC features fast computation and adaption to variations of clinical cohorts. In simulated datasets MAGIC achieved greatly improved computation efficiency and overall superior performance than the MI-based method. We applied MAGIC to construct the estrogen receptor (ER) modulated gene and gene set (representing biological function) interaction networks in breast cancer. Several novel interaction hubs and functional interactions were discovered. ER+ dependent interaction between TGFβ and NFκB was further shown to be associated with patient survival. The findings were verified in independent datasets. Using MAGIC, we also assessed the essential roles of ER modulation in another hormonal cancer, ovarian cancer. Overall, MAGIC is a systematic framework for comprehensively identifying and constructing the modulated interaction networks in a whole-genome landscape.

DISCERN takes two expression datasets as input: an expression dataset of diseased tissues from patients with a disease of interest and another expression dataset from matching normal tissues. DISCERN estimates the extent to which each gene is perturbed-having distinct regulator connectivity in the inferred gene-regulator dependencies between the disease and normal conditions. This approach has distinct advantages over existing methods. First, DISCERN infers conditional dependencies between candidate regulators and genes, where conditional dependence relationships discriminate the evidence for direct interactions from indirect interactions more precisely than pairwise correlation. Second, DISCERN uses a new likelihood-based scoring function to alleviate concerns about accuracy of the specific edges inferred in a particular network. DISCERN identifies perturbed genes more accurately in synthetic data than existing methods to identify perturbed genes between distinct states. In expression datasets from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer and lung cancer, genes with high DISCERN scores in each cancer are enriched for known tumor drivers, genes associated with the biological processes known to be important in the disease, and genes associated with patient prognosis, in the respective cancer. Finally, we show that DISCERN can uncover potential mechanisms underlying network perturbation by explaining observed epigenomic activity patterns in cancer and normal tissue types more accurately than alternative methods, based on the available epigenomic data from the ENCODE project.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Dechao</author><author>Gu, Quanquan</author><author>Ma, Jian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying gene regulatory network rewiring using latent differential graphical models.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>e140</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27378774</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkw581</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Tian, Gu, Ma - Nucleic acids research - Identifying gene regulatory network rewiring using latent differential graphical models.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/44/17/e140/2468041</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27378774</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5041474</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are highly dynamic among different tissue types. Identifying tissue-specific gene regulation is critically important to understand gene function in a particular cellular context. Graphical models have been used to estimate GRN from gene expression data to distinguish direct interactions from indirect associations. However, most existing methods estimate GRN for a specific cell/tissue type or in a tissue-naive way, or do not specifically focus on network rewiring between different tissues. Here, we describe a new method called Latent Differential Graphical Model (LDGM). The motivation of our method is to estimate the differential network between two tissue types directly without inferring the network for individual tissues, which has the advantage of utilizing much smaller sample size to achieve reliable differential network estimation. Our simulation results demonstrated that LDGM consistently outperforms other Gaussian graphical model based methods. We further evaluated LDGM by applying to the brain and blood gene expression data from the GTEx consortium. We also applied LDGM to identify network rewiring between cancer subtypes using the TCGA breast cancer samples. Our results suggest that LDGM is an effective method to infer differential network using high-throughput gene expression data to identify GRN dynamics among different cellular conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Jing</author><author>Shojaie, Ali</author><author>Michailidis, George</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Network-based pathway enrichment analysis with incomplete network information.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>3165-3174</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27357170</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btw410</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Ma, Shojaie, Michailidis - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Network-based pathway enrichment analysis with incomplete network i.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/32/20/3165/2196636</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27357170</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5939912</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION Pathway enrichment analysis has become a key tool for biomedical researchers to gain insight into the underlying biology of differentially expressed genes, proteins and metabolites. It reduces complexity and provides a system-level view of changes in cellular activity in response to treatments and/or in disease states. Methods that use existing pathway network information have been shown to outperform simpler methods that only take into account pathway membership. However, despite significant progress in understanding the association amongst members of biological pathways, and expansion of data bases containing information about interactions of biomolecules, the existing network information may be incomplete or inaccurate and is not cell-type or disease condition-specific. RESULTS We propose a constrained network estimation framework that combines network estimation based on cell- and condition-specific high-dimensional Omics data with interaction information from existing data bases. The resulting pathway topology information is subsequently used to provide a framework for simultaneous testing of differences in expression levels of pathway members, as well as their interactions. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed network estimator and the test for pathway enrichment, and investigate its small sample performance in simulated and real data settings.

Perturbing networks is one strategy for identifying modules. Here we used an advanced mathematical approach named topological data analysis (TDA) to interrogate two perturbed networks. In one, we disrupted the S. cerevisiae INO80 protein interaction network by isolating complexes after protein complex components were deleted from the genome. In the second, we reanalyzed previously published data demonstrating the disruption of the human Sin3 network with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Here we show that disrupted networks contained topological network modules (TNMs) with shared properties that mapped onto distinct locations in networks. We define TMNs as proteins that occupy close network positions depending on their coordinates in a topological space. TNMs provide new insight into networks by capturing proteins from different categories including proteins within a complex, proteins with shared biological functions, and proteins disrupted across networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Will, Thorsten</author><author>Helms, Volkhard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rewiring of the inferred protein interactome during blood development studied with the tool PPICompare.</title><secondary-title>BMC systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>44</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Alternative splicing</keyword><keyword>Differential network analysis</keyword><keyword>Hematopoiesis</keyword><keyword>Protein-protein interaction networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28376810</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12918-017-0400-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Will, Helms - BMC systems biology - Rewiring of the inferred protein interactome during blood development studied with the tool P.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://sourceforge.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28376810</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5379774</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Differential analysis of cellular conditions is a key approach towards understanding the consequences and driving causes behind biological processes such as developmental transitions or diseases. The progress of whole-genome expression profiling enabled to conveniently capture the state of a cell's transcriptome and to detect the characteristic features that distinguish cells in specific conditions. In contrast, mapping the physical protein interactome for many samples is experimentally infeasible at the moment. For the understanding of the whole system, however, it is equally important how the interactions of proteins are rewired between cellular states. To overcome this deficiency, we recently showed how condition-specific protein interaction networks that even consider alternative splicing can be inferred from transcript expression data. Here, we present the differential network analysis tool PPICompare that was specifically designed for isoform-sensitive protein interaction networks. RESULTS Besides detecting significant rewiring events between the interactomes of grouped samples, PPICompare infers which alterations to the transcriptome caused each rewiring event and what is the minimal set of alterations necessary to explain all between-group changes. When applied to the development of blood cells, we verified that a reasonable amount of rewiring events were reported by the tool and found that differential gene expression was the major determinant of cellular adjustments to the interactome. Alternative splicing events were consistently necessary in each developmental step to explain all significant alterations and were especially important for rewiring in the context of transcriptional control. CONCLUSIONS Applying PPICompare enabled us to investigate the dynamics of the human protein interactome during developmental transitions. A platform-independent implementation of the tool PPICompare is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ppicompare/ .</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zagorščak, Maja</author><author>Blejec, Andrej</author><author>Ramšak, Živa</author><author>Petek, Marko</author><author>Stare, Tjaša</author><author>Gruden, Kristina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DiNAR: revealing hidden patterns of plant signalling dynamics using Differential Network Analysis in R.</title><secondary-title>Plant methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant methods</full-title></periodical><pages>78</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Background knowledge</keyword><keyword>Biological networks</keyword><keyword>Clustering</keyword><keyword>Dynamic data visualisation</keyword><keyword>Dynamic network analysis</keyword><keyword>Gene expression</keyword><keyword>Multi-conditional datasets</keyword><keyword>Time series</keyword><keyword>Web application</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1300701803450</isbn><accession-num>30186360</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13007-018-0345-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Zagorščak et al. - Plant methods - DiNAR revealing hidden patterns of plant signalling dynamics using Differential Network Anal.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s13007-018-0345-0</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186360</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6117943</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background Progress in high-throughput molecular methods accompanied by more complex experimental designs demands novel data visualisation solutions. To specifically answer the question which parts of the specifical biological system are responding in particular perturbation, integrative approach in which experimental data are superimposed on a prior knowledge network is shown to be advantageous. Results We have developed DiNAR, Differential Network Analysis in R, a user-friendly application with dynamic visualisation that integrates multiple condition high-throughput data and extensive biological prior knowledge. Implemented differential network approach and embedded network analysis allow users to analyse condition-specific responses in the context of topology of interest (e.g. immune signalling network) and extract knowledge concerning patterns of signalling dynamics (i.e. rewiring in network structure between two or more biological conditions). We validated the usability of software on the Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum tuberosum datasets, but it is set to handle any biological instances. Conclusions DiNAR facilitates detection of network-rewiring events, gene prioritisation for future experimental design and allows capturing dynamics of complex biological system.

Existing literatures mostly focus on differential network modelling for continuous data. However, in real application, we may encounter discrete data or mixed data, which urges us to propose a unified differential network modelling for various data types. RESULTS We propose a unified latent Gaussian copula differential network model which provides deeper understanding of the unknown mechanism than that among the observed variables. Adaptive rank-based estimation approaches are proposed with the assumption that the true differential network is sparse. The adaptive estimation approaches do not require precision matrices to be sparse, and thus can allow the individual networks to contain hub nodes. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed methods achieve the same parametric convergence rate for both the difference of the precision matrices estimation and differential structure recovery, which means that the extra modeling flexibility comes at almost no cost of statistical efficiency. Besides theoretical analysis, thorough numerical simulations are conducted to compare the empirical performance of the proposed methods with some other state-of-the-art methods. The result shows that the proposed methods work quite well for various data types. The proposed method is then applied on gene expression data associated with lung cancer to illustrate its empirical usefulness. CONCLUSIONS The proposed latent variable differential network models allows for various data-types and thus are more flexible, which also provide deeper understanding of the unknown mechanism than that among the observed variables. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and real application all demonstrate the great advantages of the latent differential network modelling and thus are highly recommended.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de la Fuente, Alberto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From 'differential expression' to 'differential networking' - identification of dysfunctional regulatory networks in diseases.</title><secondary-title>Trends in genetics : TIG</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in genetics : TIG</full-title></periodical><pages>326-33</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20570387</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tig.2010.05.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - de la Fuente - Trends in genetics TIG - From 'differential expression' to 'differential networking' - identification of dysfunct.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0168952510000879/1-s2.0-S0168952510000879-main.pdf?_tid=ea95cee0-5716-466c-ba94-0fa4bd5327cf&amp;acdnat=1552945222_b97591b3875a42fd8005fe935795e6ba</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20570387</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Understanding diseases requires identifying the differences between healthy and affected tissues. Gene expression data have revolutionized the study of diseases by making it possible to simultaneously consider thousands of genes. The identification of disease-associated genes requires studying the genes in the context of the regulatory systems they are involved in. A major goal is to identify specific regulatory networks that are dysfunctional in a given disease state. Although we still have not reached a stage where the elucidation of differential regulatory networks is commonly feasible, recent advances have described the first steps towards this goal - the identification of differential coexpression networks. This review describes the shift from differential gene expression to differential networking and outlines how this shift will affect the study of the genetic basis of disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ideker, Trey</author><author>Krogan, Nevan J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential network biology.</title><secondary-title>Molecular systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>565</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords><keyword>Subject Categories: bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>functional genomics Keywords: genetic interactions</keyword><keyword>networks</keyword><keyword>protein interactions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22252388</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/msb.2011.99</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Ideker, Krogan - Molecular systems biology - Differential network biology.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.molecularsystemsbiology.com</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22252388</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3296360</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Protein and genetic interaction maps can reveal the overall physical and functional landscape of a biological system. To date, these interaction maps have typically been generated under a single condition, even though biological systems undergo differential change that is dependent on environment, tissue type, disease state, development or speciation. Several recent interaction mapping studies have demonstrated the power of differential analysis for elucidating fundamental biological responses, revealing that the architecture of an interactome can be massively re-wired during a cellular or adaptive response. Here, we review the technological developments and experimental designs that have enabled differential network mapping at very large scales and highlight biological insight that has been derived from this type of analysis. We argue that differential network mapping, which allows for the interrogation of previously unexplored interaction spaces, will become a standard mode of network analysis in the future, just as differential gene expression and protein phosphorylation studies are already pervasive in genomic and proteomic analysis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Basha, Omer</author><author>Shpringer, Rotem</author><author>Argov, Chanan M</author><author>Yeger-Lotem, Esti</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The DifferentialNet database of differential protein-protein interactions in human tissues.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D522-D526</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>D1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29069447</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkx981</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Basha et al. - Nucleic acids research - The DifferentialNet database of differential protein-protein interactions in human tissue.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/diffnet</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29069447</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5753382</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>DifferentialNet is a novel database that provides users with differential interactome analysis of human tissues (http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/diffnet/). Users query DifferentialNet by protein, and retrieve its differential protein-protein interactions (PPIs) per tissue via an interactive graphical interface. To compute differential PPIs, we integrated available data of experimentally detected PPIs with RNA-sequencing profiles of tens of human tissues gathered by the Genotype-Tissue Expression consortium (GTEx) and by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). We associated each PPI with a score that reflects whether its corresponding genes were expressed similarly across tissues, or were up- or down-regulated in the selected tissue. By this, users can identify tissue-specific interactions, filter out PPIs that are relatively stable across tissues, and highlight PPIs that show relative changes across tissues.

We then applied a machine learning classifier to distinguish a spectrum of malignant cell types whose abundances varied between patients and between subclones in the same tumor. Cell type compositions correlated with prototypic genetic lesions, including an association of FLT3-ITD with abundant progenitor-like cells. Primitive AML cells exhibited dysregulated transcriptional programs with co-expression of stemness and myeloid priming genes and had prognostic significance. Differentiated monocyte-like AML cells expressed diverse immunomodulatory genes and suppressed T cell activity in vitro. In conclusion, we provide single-cell technologies and an atlas of AML cell states, regulators, and markers with implications for precision medicine and immune therapies.

Many inference methods exist, but the resulting GRN is generally sensitive to the choice of method-specific parameters. Even though the inferred GRN is optimal given the parameters, many links may be wrong or missing if the data is not informative. To make GRN inference reliable, a method is needed to estimate the support of each predicted link as the method parameters are varied. RESULTS To achieve this we have developed a method called nested bootstrapping, which applies a bootstrapping protocol to GRN inference, and by repeated bootstrap runs assesses the stability of the estimated support values. To translate bootstrap support values to false discovery rates we run the same pipeline with shuffled data as input. This provides a general method to control the false discovery rate of GRN inference that can be applied to any setting of inference parameters, noise level, or data properties. We evaluated nested bootstrapping on a simulated dataset spanning a range of such properties, using the LASSO, Least Squares, RNI, GENIE3 and CLR inference methods. An improved inference accuracy was observed in almost all situations. Nested bootstrapping was incorporated into the GeneSPIDER package, which was also used for generating the simulated networks and data, as well as running and analyzing the inferences.

Our model accurately estimates transcript expression and additionally provides the full probability distribution and credible intervals for each transcript. We further show how this enables MERFISH to scale towards the whole genome while being able to control the uncertainty in obtained results. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION The presented model is implemented on top of Rust-Bio (Köster, 2016) and available open-source as MERFISHtools (https://merfishtools.github.io). It can be easily installed via Bioconda (Grüning et al., 2018). The entire analysis performed in this paper is provided as a fully reproducible Snakemake (Köster and Rahmann, 2012) workflow via Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.752340).

These genes usually play an essential role in gene regulation and cellular processes. Despite recent advancements in high-throughput technology, inferring gene networks with hub genes from high-dimensional data still remains a challenging problem. Novel statistical network inference methods are needed for efficient and accurate reconstruction of hub networks from high-dimensional data. RESULTS To address this challenge we propose DW-Lasso, a degree weighted Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method which infers gene networks with hubs efficiently under the low sample size setting. Our network reconstruction approach is formulated as a two stage procedure: first, the degree of networks is estimated iteratively, and second, the gene regulatory network is reconstructed using degree information. A useful property of the proposed method is that it naturally favors the accumulation of neighbors around hub genes and thereby helps in accurate modeling of the high-throughput data under the assumption that the underlying network exhibits hub structure. In a simulation study, we demonstrate good predictive performance of the proposed method in comparison to traditional Lasso type methods in inferring hub and scale-free graphs. We show the effectiveness of our method in an application to microarray data of Escherichia coli and RNA sequencing data of Kidney Clear Cell Carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets.

Bioinformatics provides in silico tools, such as machine learning-based models, to guide the discovery of targets for the proteases responsible for protein cleavage. State-of-the-art models have a scope limited to specific protease families (such as Caspases), and do not explicitly include biological or medical knowledge (such as the hierarchical protein domain similarity or gene-gene interactions). To fill this gap, we present a novel approach for protease target prediction based on data integration. RESULTS By representing protease-protein target information in the form of relational matrices, we design a model (i) that is general and not limited to a single protease family, and (b) leverages on the available knowledge, managing extremely sparse data from heterogeneous data sources, including primary sequence, pathways, domains and interactions. When compared with other algorithms on test data, our approach provides a better performance even for models specifically focusing on a single protease family.

For example, contact prediction can be used to reduce the computational complexity of predicting the structure of proteins and even to help identify functionally important regions of proteins. These predictions are becoming especially important given the relatively low number of experimentally determined protein structures compared to the amount of available protein sequence data. RESULTS Here we have developed and benchmarked a set of machine learning methods for performing residue-residue contact prediction, including random forests, direct-coupling analysis, support vector machines, and deep networks (stacked denoising autoencoders). These methods are able to predict contacting residue pairs given only the amino acid sequence of a protein. According to our own evaluations performed at a resolution of +/- two residues, the predictors we trained with the random forest algorithm were our top performing methods with average top 10 prediction accuracy scores of 85.13% (short range), 74.49% (medium range), and 54.49% (long range). Our ensemble models (stacked denoising autoencoders combined with support vector machines) were our best performing deep network predictors and achieved top 10 prediction accuracy scores of 75.51% (short range), 60.26% (medium range), and 43.85% (long range) using the same evaluation. These tests were blindly performed on targets from the CASP11 dataset; and the results suggested that our models achieved comparable performance to contact predictors developed by groups that participated in CASP11. CONCLUSIONS Due to the challenging nature of contact prediction, it is beneficial to develop and benchmark a variety of different prediction methods. Our work has produced useful tools with a simple interface that can provide contact predictions to users without requiring a lengthy installation process. In addition to this, we have released our C++ implementation of the direct-coupling analysis method as a standalone software package.

Current practice employs one of the two most recent human reference genome versions: HG19 or HG38. To date, the impact of genome version on SNV identification has not been rigorously assessed. METHODS We conducted analysis comparing the SNVs identified based on HG19 vs HG38, leveraging whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from the genome-in-a-bottle (GIAB) project. First, SNVs were called using 26 different bioinformatics pipelines with either HG19 or HG38. Next, two tools were used to convert the called SNVs between HG19 and HG38. Lastly we calculated conversion rates, analyzed discordant rates between SNVs called with HG19 or HG38, and characterized the discordant SNVs. RESULTS The conversion rates from HG38 to HG19 (average 95%) were lower than the conversion rates from HG19 to HG38 (average 99%). The conversion rates varied slightly among the various calling pipelines. Around 1.5% SNVs were discordantly converted between HG19 or HG38. The conversions from HG38 to HG19 had more SNVs which failed conversion and more discordant SNVs than the opposite conversion (HG19 to HG38). Most of the discordant SNVs had low read depth, were low confidence SNVs as defined by GIAB, and/or were predominated by G/C alleles (52% observed versus 42% expected). CONCLUSION A significant number of SNVs could not be converted between HG19 and HG38. Based on careful review of our comparisons, we recommend HG38 (the newer version) for NGS SNV analysis. To summarize, our findings suggest caution when translating identified SNVs between different versions of the human reference genome.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tiong, Khong-Loon</author><author>Yeang, Chen-Hsiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MGSEA - a multivariate Gene set enrichment analysis.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>145</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Gene set enrichment analysis</keyword><keyword>Multimodal OMIC data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30885118</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-019-2716-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Tiong, Yeang - BMC bioinformatics - MGSEA - a multivariate Gene set enrichment analysis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2716-6</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30885118</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a powerful tool to identify enriched functional categories of informative biomarkers. Canonical GSEA takes one-dimensional feature scores derived from the data of one platform as inputs. Numerous extensions of GSEA handling multimodal OMIC data are proposed, yet none of them explicitly captures combinatorial relations of feature scores from multiple platforms. RESULTS We propose multivariate GSEA (MGSEA) to capture combinatorial relations of gene set enrichment among multiple platform features. MGSEA successfully captures designed feature relations from simulated data. By applying it to the scores of delineating breast cancer and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) subtypes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets of CNV, DNA methylation and mRNA expressions, we find that breast cancer and GBM data yield both similar and distinct outcomes. Among the enriched functional categories, subtype-specific biomarkers are dominated by mRNA expression in many functional categories in both cancer types and also by CNV in many functional categories in breast cancer. The enriched functional categories belonging to distinct combinatorial patterns are involved different oncogenic processes: cell proliferation (such as cell cycle control, estrogen responses, MYC and E2F targets) for mRNA expression in breast cancer, invasion and metastasis (such as cell adhesion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)) for CNV in breast cancer, and diverse processes (such as immune and inflammatory responses, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and EMT) for mRNA expression in GBM. These observations persist in two external datasets (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) for breast cancer and Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) for GBM) and are consistent with knowledge of cancer subtypes. We further compare the characteristics of MGSEA with several extensions of GSEA and point out the pros and cons of each method. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the utility of MGSEA by inferring the combinatorial relations of multiple platforms for cancer subtype delineation in three multi-OMIC datasets: TCGA, METABRIC and REMBRANDT. The inferred combinatorial patterns are consistent with the current knowledge and also reveal novel insights about cancer subtypes. MGSEA can be further applied to any genotype-phenotype association problems with multimodal OMIC data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haigis, Kevin M</author><author>Cichowski, Karen</author><author>Elledge, Stephen J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tissue-specificity in cancer: The rule, not the exception.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>1150-1151</pages><volume>363</volume><issue>6432</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30872507</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.aaw3472</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Haigis, Cichowski, Elledge - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Tissue-specificity in cancer The rule, not the exception.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aaw3472</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872507</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:tissuespec</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McDonald, E.

We describe findings of this screen, outlining the classes of cancer dependency genes and their relationships to genetic, expression, and lineage features. In addition, we describe robust gene-interaction networks recapitulating both protein complexes and functional cooperation among complexes and pathways.

Whole genome RNAi screening of lung cancer cell lines provides an ideal source for determining candidate drug targets. RESULTS Unsupervised learning algorithms uncovered patterns of differential vulnerability across lung cancer cell lines to loss of functionally related genes. Such genetic vulnerabilities represent candidate targets for therapy and are found to be involved in splicing, translation and protein folding. In particular, many NSCLC cell lines were especially sensitive to the loss of components of the LSm2-8 protein complex or the CCT/TRiC chaperonin.

Furthermore, the predicted vulnerability of a single adenocarcinoma cell line to loss of the Wnt pathway was experimentally validated with screening of small-molecule Wnt inhibitors against an extensive cell line panel.

To examine this potential, here we evaluate the ability of stateoftheart sequence analysis methods to specifically recover known cancer genes. While some cancer genes are identified by analysis of recurrence, spatial clustering or predicted impact of somatic mutations, many remain undetected due to lack of power to discriminate driver mutations from the background mutational load (1360% recall of cancer genes impacted by somatic singlenucleotide variants, depending on the method). Cancer genes not detected by mutation recurrence also tend to be missed by all types of exome analysis. Nonetheless, these genes are implicated by other experiments such as functional genetic screens and expression profiling. These challenges are only partially addressed by increasing sample size and will likely hold even as greater numbers of tumours are analysed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Srivas, Rohith</author><author>Shen, John Paul</author><author>Yang, Chih Cheng</author><author>Sun, Su Ming</author><author>Li, Jianfeng</author><author>Gross, Andrew M.</author><author>Jensen, James</author><author>Licon, Katherine</author><author>Bojorquez-Gomez, Ana</author><author>Klepper, Kristin</author><author>Huang, Justin</author><author>Pekin, Daniel</author><author>Xu, Jia L.</author><author>Yeerna, Huwate</author><author>Sivaganesh, Vignesh</author><author>Kollenstart, Leonie</author><author>van Attikum, Haico</author><author>Aza-Blanc, Pedro</author><author>Sobol, Robert W.</author><author>Ideker, Trey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Network of Conserved Synthetic Lethal Interactions for Exploration of Precision Cancer Therapy.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cell</full-title></periodical><pages>514-25</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Cell Press</publisher><isbn>1097-2765</isbn><accession-num>27453043</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molcel.2016.06.022</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Srivas et al. - Molecular cell - A Network of Conserved Synthetic Lethal Interactions for Exploration of Precision Cancer Therapy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276516302805?via%3Dihub</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27453043</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5209245</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>An emerging therapeutic strategy for cancer is to induce selective lethality in a tumor by exploiting interactions between its driving mutations and specific drug targets. Here we use a multi-species approach to develop a resource of synthetic lethal interactions relevant to cancer therapy. First, we screen in yeast ∼169,000 potential interactions among orthologs of human tumor suppressor genes (TSG) and genes encoding drug targets across multiple genotoxic environments. Guided by the strongest signal, we evaluate thousands of TSG-drug combinations in HeLa cells, resulting in networks of conserved synthetic lethal interactions. Analysis of these networks reveals that interaction stability across environments and shared gene function increase the likelihood of observing an interaction in human cancer cells. Using these rules, we prioritize ∼10(5) human TSG-drug combinations for future follow-up. We validate interactions based on cell and/or patient survival, including topoisomerases with RAD17 and checkpoint kinases with BLM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Tim</author><author>Yu, Haiyan</author><author>Hughes, Nicholas W.</author><author>Liu, Bingxu</author><author>Kendirli, Arek</author><author>Klein, Klara</author><author>Chen, Walter W.</author><author>Lander, Eric S.</author><author>Sabatini, David M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gene Essentiality Profiling Reveals Gene Networks and Synthetic Lethal Interactions with Oncogenic Ras.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>890-903.e15</pages><volume>168</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>AML</keyword><keyword>CRISPR</keyword><keyword>RAS</keyword><keyword>gene networks</keyword><keyword>genetic screens</keyword><keyword>synthetic lethality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Cell Press</publisher><accession-num>28162770</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2017.01.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Wang et al. - Cell - Gene Essentiality Profiling Reveals Gene Networks and Synthetic Lethal Interactions with Oncogenic Ras.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867417300612?via%3Dihub</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28162770</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5445660</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The genetic dependencies of human cancers widely vary. Here, we catalog this heterogeneity and use it to identify functional gene interactions and genotype-dependent liabilities in cancer. By using genome-wide CRISPR-based screens, we generate a gene essentiality dataset across 14 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Sets of genes with correlated patterns of essentiality across the lines reveal new gene relationships, the essential substrates of enzymes, and the molecular functions of uncharacterized proteins. Comparisons of differentially essential genes between Ras-dependent and -independent lines uncover synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic Ras. Screens in both human AML and engineered mouse pro-B cells converge on a surprisingly small number of genes in the Ras processing and MAPK pathways and pinpoint PREX1 as an AML-specific activator of MAPK signaling. Our findings suggest general strategies for defining mammalian gene networks and synthetic lethal interactions by exploiting the natural genetic and epigenetic diversity of human cancer cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sinha, Subarna</author><author>Thomas, Daniel</author><author>Chan, Steven</author><author>Gao, Yang</author><author>Brunen, Diede</author><author>Torabi, Damoun</author><author>Reinisch, Andreas</author><author>Hernandez, David</author><author>Chan, Andy</author><author>Rankin, Erinn B.</author><author>Bernards, Rene</author><author>Majeti, Ravindra</author><author>Dill, David L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systematic discovery of mutation-specific synthetic lethals by mining pan-cancer human primary tumor data.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>15580</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords><keyword>Data mining</keyword><keyword>Target identification</keyword><keyword>Targeted therapies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>28561042</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms15580</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Sinha et al. - Nature communications - Systematic discovery of mutation-specific synthetic lethals by mining pan-cancer human pri.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms15580</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28561042</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5460027</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Two genes are synthetically lethal (SL) when defects in both are lethal to a cell but a single defect is non-lethal. SL partners of cancer mutations are of great interest as pharmacological targets; however, identifying them by cell line-based methods is challenging. Here we develop MiSL (Mining Synthetic Lethals), an algorithm that mines pan-cancer human primary tumour data to identify mutation-specific SL partners for specific cancers. We apply MiSL to 12 different cancers and predict 145,891 SL partners for 3,120 mutations, including known mutation-specific SL partners. Comparisons with functional screens show that MiSL predictions are enriched for SLs in multiple cancers. We extensively validate a SL interaction identified by MiSL between the IDH1 mutation and ACACA in leukaemia using gene targeting and patient-derived xenografts. Furthermore, we apply MiSL to pinpoint genetic biomarkers for drug sensitivity.

Here, we present a computational method to predict and exploit synthetic lethality in cancer metabolism. Our approach relies on the concept of genetic minimal cut sets and gene expression data, demonstrating a superior performance to previous approaches predicting metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer. Our genetic minimal cut set computational framework is applied to evaluate the lethality of ribonucleotide reductase catalytic subunit M1 (RRM1) inhibition in multiple myeloma. We present a computational and experimental study of the effect of RRM1 inhibition in four multiple myeloma cell lines. In addition, using publicly available genome-scale loss-of-function screens, a possible mechanism by which the inhibition of RRM1 is effective in cancer is established. Overall, our approach shows promising results and lays the foundation to build a novel family of algorithms to target metabolism in cancer.Exploiting synthetic lethality is a promising approach for cancer therapy. Here, the authors present an approach to identifying such interactions by finding genetic minimal cut sets (gMCSs) that block cancer proliferation, and apply it to study the lethality of RRM1 inhibition in multiple myeloma.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ivanov, Andrei A</author><author>Revennaugh, Brian</author><author>Rusnak, Lauren</author><author>Gonzalez-Pecchi, Valentina</author><author>Mo, Xiulei</author><author>Johns, Margaret A</author><author>Du, Yuhong</author><author>Cooper, Lee A D</author><author>Moreno, Carlos S</author><author>Khuri, Fadlo R</author><author>Fu, Haian</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Berger, Bonnie</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>The OncoPPi Portal: an integrative resource to explore and prioritize protein-protein interactions for cancer target discovery.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>1183-1191</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><accession-num>29186335</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btx743</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Ivanov et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - The OncoPPi Portal an integrative resource to explore and prioritize protein-p.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/7/1183/4657070</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29186335</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6030952</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation As cancer genomics initiatives move toward comprehensive identification of genetic alterations in cancer, attention is now turning to understanding how interactions among these genes lead to the acquisition of tumor hallmarks. Emerging pharmacological and clinical data suggest a highly promising role of cancer-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as druggable cancer targets. However, large-scale experimental identification of cancer-related PPIs remains challenging, and currently available resources to explore oncogenic PPI networks are limited. Results Recently, we have developed a PPI high-throughput screening platform to detect PPIs between cancer-associated proteins in the context of cancer cells. Here, we present the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows investigators to access, manipulate and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines. To facilitate prioritization of PPIs for further biological studies, this resource combines network connectivity analysis, mutual exclusivity analysis of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins and domain-domain interactions. Estimates of PPI essentiality allow users to evaluate the functional impact of PPI disruption on cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, connecting the OncoPPi network with the approved drugs and compounds in clinical trials enables discovery of new tumor dependencies to inform strategies to interrogate undruggable targets like tumor suppressors. The OncoPPi Portal serves as a resource for the cancer research community to facilitate discovery of cancer targets and therapeutic development.

Here we present a data-driven approach, ISLE (identification of clinically relevant synthetic lethality), that mines TCGA cohort to identify the most likely clinically relevant SL interactions (cSLi) from a given candidate set of lab-screened SLi. We first validate ISLE via a benchmark of large-scale drug response screens and by predicting drug efficacy in mouse xenograft models. We then experimentally test a select set of predicted cSLi via new screening experiments, validating their predicted context-specific sensitivity in hypoxic vs normoxic conditions and demonstrating cSLi's utility in predicting synergistic drug combinations. We show that cSLi can successfully predict patients' drug treatment response and provide patient stratification signatures. ISLE thus complements existing actionable mutation-based methods for precision cancer therapy, offering an opportunity to expand its scope to the whole genome.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McFarland, James M.</author><author>Ho, Zandra V.</author><author>Kugener, Guillaume</author><author>Dempster, Joshua M.</author><author>Montgomery, Phillip G.</author><author>Bryan, Jordan G.</author><author>Krill-Burger, John M.</author><author>Green, Thomas M.</author><author>Vazquez, Francisca</author><author>Boehm, Jesse S.</author><author>Golub, Todd R.</author><author>Hahn, William C.</author><author>Root, David E.</author><author>Tsherniak, Aviad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improved estimation of cancer dependencies from large-scale RNAi screens using model-based normalization and data integration.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>4610</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Computational models</keyword><keyword>Data integration</keyword><keyword>Data processing</keyword><keyword>Genome informatics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>30389920</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-018-06916-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - McFarland et al. - Nature communications - Improved estimation of cancer dependencies from large-scale RNAi screens using model-b.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06916-5</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30389920</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6214982</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The availability of multiple datasets comprising genome-scale RNAi viability screens in hundreds of diverse cancer cell lines presents new opportunities for understanding cancer vulnerabilities.

Ras proteins share ~85% amino acid identity, are activated by and signal through the same proteins, and can exhibit functional redundancy. Nevertheless, manipulating expression or activation of each isoform yields different cellular responses and tumorigenic phenotypes, even when different ras genes are expressed from the same locus. We now report a novel regulatory mechanism hardwired into the very sequence of RAS genes that underlies how such similar proteins impact tumorigenesis differently. Specifically, despite their high sequence similarity, KRAS is poorly translated compared to HRAS due to enrichment in genomically underrepresented or rare codons. Converting rare to common codons increases KRas expression and tumorigenicity to mirror that of HRas. Furthermore, in a genome-wide survey, similar gene pairs with opposing codon bias were identified that not only manifest dichotomous protein expression but also are enriched in key signaling protein classes and pathways. Thus, synonymous nucleotide differences affecting codon usage account for differences between HRas and KRas expression and function and may represent a broader regulation strategy in cell signaling.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Santra, Tapesh</author><author>Herrero, Ana</author><author>Rodriguez, Javier</author><author>von Kriegsheim, Alex</author><author>Iglesias-Martinez, Luis F.</author><author>Schwarzl, Thomas</author><author>Higgins, Des</author><author>Aye, Thin-Thin</author><author>Heck, Albert J R</author><author>Calvo, Fernando</author><author>Agudo-Ibáñez, Lorena</author><author>Crespo, Piero</author><author>Matallanas, David</author><author>Kolch, Walter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Integrated Global Analysis of Compartmentalized HRAS Signaling.</title><secondary-title>Cell reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell reports</full-title></periodical><pages>3100-3115.e7</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>RAS</keyword><keyword>TP53</keyword><keyword>apoptosis</keyword><keyword>cell migration</keyword><keyword>network biology</keyword><keyword>proteomics</keyword><keyword>signal transduction data integration</keyword><keyword>subcellular compartmentalization</keyword><keyword>transcriptomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30865897</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.celrep.2019.02.038</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Santra et al. - Cell reports - An Integrated Global Analysis of Compartmentalized HRAS Signaling.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.02.038</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30865897</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Modern omics technologies allow us to obtain global information on different types of biological networks. However, integrating these different types of analyses into a coherent framework for a comprehensive biological interpretation remains challenging. Here, we present a conceptual framework that integrates protein interaction, phosphoproteomics, and transcriptomics data. Applying this method to analyze HRAS signaling from different subcellular compartments shows that spatially defined networks contribute specific functions to HRAS signaling. Changes in HRAS protein interactions at different sites lead to different kinase activation patterns that differentially regulate gene transcription. HRAS-mediated signaling is the strongest from the cell membrane, but it regulates the largest number of genes from the endoplasmic reticulum. The integrated networks provide a topologically and functionally resolved view of HRAS signaling. They reveal distinct HRAS functions including the control of cell migration from the endoplasmic reticulum and TP53-dependent cell survival when signaling from the Golgi apparatus.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ferrer, Irene</author><author>Zugazagoitia, Jon</author><author>Herbertz, Stephan</author><author>John, William</author><author>Paz-Ares, Luis</author><author>Schmid-Bindert, Gerald</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KRAS-Mutant non-small cell lung cancer: From biology to therapy.</title><secondary-title>Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)</full-title></periodical><pages>53-64</pages><volume>124</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>KRAS mutations</keyword><keyword>MAPK pathway</keyword><keyword>Molecular targeted therapies</keyword><keyword>NSCLC</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><accession-num>30268480</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.lungcan.2018.07.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Ferrer et al. - Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands) - KRAS-Mutant non-small cell lung cancer From biology to therapy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2018.07.013</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268480</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most frequent oncogene driver mutation in Western countries is Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and KRAS-mutant NSCLC is associated with smoking. There are various sources of biological heterogeneity of KRAS-mutant NSCLC, including different genotypes that may be associated with specific clinical outcomes, the presence of other co-mutations that exhibit different biological features and drug sensitivity patterns, and mutant allelic content. The efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC is generally poor and numerous novel therapeutic strategies have been developed. These approaches include targeting KRAS membrane associations, targeting downstream signalling pathways, the use of KRAS synthetic lethality, direct targeting of KRAS, and immunotherapy. Of these, immunotherapy may be one of the most promising treatment approaches for patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Recent data also suggest the potential for distinct efficacy of immunotherapy according to the presence of other co-mutations. In view of the biological heterogeneity of KRAS-mutant NSCLC, treatment will likely need to be individualised and, in future, may require the use of rational combinations of treatment, many of which are currently under investigation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhan, T</author><author>Rindtorff, N</author><author>Boutros, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wnt signaling in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Oncogene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncogene</full-title></periodical><pages>1461-1473</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Cancer genetics</keyword><keyword>Cell signalling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>27617575</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/onc.2016.304</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Zhan, Rindtorff, Boutros - Oncogene - Wnt signaling in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/onc2016304</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27617575</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5357762</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Wnt signaling is one of the key cascades regulating development and stemness, and has also been tightly associated with cancer. The role of Wnt signaling in carcinogenesis has most prominently been described for colorectal cancer, but aberrant Wnt signaling is observed in many more cancer entities.

Furthermore, we highlight expanding functions of Wnt signaling for both solid and liquid tumors. We also describe current findings how Wnt signaling affects maintenance of cancer stem cells, metastasis and immune control.

We show that the RTKs MET, EGFR, and PDGFR regulate microRNA-134 (miR-134) in GBM. We find that miR-134 is downregulated in human tumors and cancer stem cells and that its expression inversely correlates with the activation of MET, EGFR, and PDGFR. We demonstrate that miR-134 inhibits cancer cell and stem-cell proliferation, survival, and xenograft growth, as well as cancer stem-cell self-renewal and stemness. We identify KRAS and STAT5B as targets of miR-134, and establish molecular and functional links between RTKs, miR-134, KRAS/STAT5B and malignancy in vitro and in vivo. We show that miR-134 induction is required for the anti-tumor effects of RTK inhibitors. We also uncover the molecular pathways through which RTKs regulate miR-134 expression and demonstrate the involvement of MAPK signaling and the KLF4 transcription factor. We therefore identify miR-134 as a novel RTK-regulated tumor-suppressive hub that mediates RTK and RTK-inhibitor effects on GBM malignancy by controlling KRAS and STAT5B.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liao, Wen-Ting</author><author>Ye, Ya-Ping</author><author>Zhang, Nian-Jie</author><author>Li, Ting-Ting</author><author>Wang, Shu-Yang</author><author>Cui, Yan-Mei</author><author>Qi, Lu</author><author>Wu, Ping</author><author>Jiao, Hong-Li</author><author>Xie, Yi-Jun</author><author>Zhang, Chi</author><author>Wang, Jun-Xian</author><author>Ding, Yan-Qing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MicroRNA-30b functions as a tumour suppressor in human colorectal cancer by targeting KRAS, PIK3CD and BCL2.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of pathology</full-title></periodical><pages>415-27</pages><volume>232</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>BCL2</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>PIK3CD</keyword><keyword>apoptosis</keyword><keyword>colorectal cancer</keyword><keyword>miR-30b</keyword><keyword>proliferation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24293274</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/path.4309</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Liao et al. - The Journal of pathology - MicroRNA-30b functions as a tumour suppressor in human colorectal cancer by targeting KR.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24293274</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the USA. MicroRNAs play important roles in the pathogenesis of CRC. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-30b in CRC and found that its expression was significantly lower in CRC tissues than that in normal tissues. We showed that a low expression level of miR-30b was closely related to poor differentiation, advanced TNM stage and poor prognosis of CRC. Further experiments showed that over-expression of miR-30b suppressed CRC cell proliferation in vitro and tumour growth in vivo. Specifically, miR-30b promoted G1 arrest and induced apoptosis. Moreover, KRAS, PIK3CD and BCL2 were identified as direct and functional targets of miR-30b. MiR-30b directly targeted the 3'-untranslated regions of their mRNAs and repressed their expression. This study revealed functional and mechanistic links between miRNA-30b and oncogene KRAS, PIK3CD and BCL2 in the pathogenesis of CRC. MiR-30b not only plays important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumour growth in CRC, but is also a potential prognostic marker or therapeutic target for CRC. Restoration of miR-30b expression may represent a promising therapeutic approach for targeting malignant CRC.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tanaka, M</author><author>Suzuki, H I</author><author>Shibahara, J</author><author>Kunita, A</author><author>Isagawa, T</author><author>Yoshimi, A</author><author>Kurokawa, M</author><author>Miyazono, K</author><author>Aburatani, H</author><author>Ishikawa, S</author><author>Fukayama, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EVI1 oncogene promotes KRAS pathway through suppression of microRNA-96 in pancreatic carcinogenesis.</title><secondary-title>Oncogene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncogene</full-title></periodical><pages>2454-63</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>Oncogenes</keyword><keyword>Oncogenesis</keyword><keyword>Pancreatic cancer</keyword><keyword>miRNAs</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>23752186</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/onc.2013.204</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Tanaka et al. - Oncogene - EVI1 oncogene promotes KRAS pathway through suppression of microRNA-96 in pancreatic carcinogenesis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/onc2013204</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23752186</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Despite frequent KRAS mutation, the early molecular mechanisms of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development have not been fully elucidated. By tracking a potential regulator of another feature of PDAC precursors, acquisition of foregut or gastric epithelial gene signature, we herein report that aberrant overexpression of ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) oncoprotein, which is usually absent in normal pancreatic duct, is a widespread marker across the full spectrum of human PDAC precursors and PDAC. In pancreatic cancer cells, EVI1 depletion caused remarkable inhibition of cell growth and migration, indicating its oncogenic roles. Importantly, we found that EVI1 upregulated KRAS expression through suppression of a potent KRAS suppressor, miR-96, in pancreatic cancer cells. Collectively, the present findings suggest that EVI1 overexpression and KRAS mutation converge on activation of the KRAS pathway in early phases of pancreatic carcinogenesis and propose EVI1 and/or miR-96 as early markers and therapeutic targets in this dismal disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gastaldi, Cécile</author><author>Bertero, Thomas</author><author>Xu, Ning</author><author>Bourget-Ponzio, Isabelle</author><author>Lebrigand, Kévin</author><author>Fourre, Sandra</author><author>Popa, Alexandra</author><author>Cardot-Leccia, Nathalie</author><author>Meneguzzi, Guerrino</author><author>Sonkoly, Enikö</author><author>Pivarcsi, Andor</author><author>Mari, Bernard</author><author>Barbry, Pascal</author><author>Ponzio, Gilles</author><author>Rezzonico, Roger</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>miR-193b/365a cluster controls progression of epidermal squamous cell carcinoma.</title><secondary-title>Carcinogenesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Carcinogenesis</full-title></periodical><pages>1110-20</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24374827</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/carcin/bgt490</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Gastaldi et al. - Carcinogenesis - miR-193b365a cluster controls progression of epidermal squamous cell carcinoma.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24374827</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs) constantly increases in the Caucasian population. Developing preferentially on precancerous lesions such as actinic keratoses due to chronic sunlight exposure, cSCCs result from the malignant transformation of keratinocytes. Although a resection of the primary tumor is usually curative, a subset of aggressive cSCCs shows a high risk of recurrence and metastases. The characterization of the molecular dysfunctions involved in cSCC development should help to identify new relevant targets against these aggressive cSCCs. In that context, we have used small RNA sequencing to identify 100 microRNAs (miRNAs) whose expression was altered during chemically induced mouse skin tumorigenesis. The decreased expression of the miR-193b/365a cluster during tumor progression suggests a tumor suppressor role. Ectopic expression of these miRNAs in tumor cells indeed inhibited their proliferation, clonogenic potential and migration, which were stimulated in normal keratinocytes when these miRNAs were blocked with antisense oligonucleotides. A combination of in silico predictions and transcriptome analyses identified several target genes of interest. We validated KRAS and MAX as direct targets of miR-193b and miR-365a. Repression of these targets using siRNAs mimicked the effects of miR-193b and miR-365a, suggesting that these genes might mediate, at least in part, the tumor-suppressive action of these miRNAs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shin, Ki-Hyuk</author><author>Bae, Susan D</author><author>Hong, Hannah S</author><author>Kim, Reuben H</author><author>Kang, Mo K</author><author>Park, No-Hee</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>miR-181a shows tumor suppressive effect against oral squamous cell carcinoma cells by downregulating K-ras.</title><secondary-title>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</full-title></periodical><pages>896-902</pages><volume>404</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>K-ras</keyword><keyword>Oral cancer</keyword><keyword>Tumor suppressor</keyword><keyword>miR-181a</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21167132</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.12.055</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Shin et al. - Biochemical and biophysical research communications - miR-181a shows tumor suppressive effect against oral squamous.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://ferrolab.dmi.unict.it/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21167132</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic regulators of gene expression, and their deregulation plays an important role in human cancer, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Recently, we found that miRNA-181a (miR-181a) was upregulated during replicative senescence of normal human oral keratinocytes. Since senescence is considered as a tumor suppressive mechanism, we thus investigated the expression and biological role of miR-181a in OSCC. We found that miR-181a was frequently downregulated in OSCC. Ectopic expression of miR-181a suppressed proliferation and anchorage independent growth ability of OSCC. Moreover, miR-181a dramatically reduces the growth of OSCC on three dimensional organotypic raft culture. We also identified K-ras as a novel target of miR-181a. miR-181a decreased K-ras protein level as well as the luciferase activity of reporter vectors containing the 3'-untranslated region of K-ras gene. Finally, we defined a minimal regulatory region of miR-181a and found a positive correlation between its promoter activity and the level of miR-181a expression. In conclusion, miR-181a may function as an OSCC suppressor by targeting on K-ras oncogene. Thus, miR-181a should be considered for therapeutic application for OSCC.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tanic, Miljana</author><author>Yanowsky, Kira</author><author>Rodriguez-Antona, Cristina</author><author>Andrés, Raquel</author><author>Márquez-Rodas, Iván</author><author>Osorio, Ana</author><author>Benitez, Javier</author><author>Martinez-Delgado, Beatriz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deregulated miRNAs in hereditary breast cancer revealed a role for miR-30c in regulating KRAS oncogene.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e38847</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22701724</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0038847</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Tanic et al. - PloS one - Deregulated miRNAs in hereditary breast cancer revealed a role for miR-30c in regulating KRAS oncogene.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.plosone.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22701724</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3372467</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Aberrant miRNA expression has been previously established in breast cancer and has clinical relevance. However, no studies so far have defined miRNAs deregulated in hereditary breast tumors. In this study we investigated the role of miRNAs in hereditary breast tumors comparing with normal breast tissue. Global miRNA expression profiling using Exiqon microarrays was performed on 22 hereditary breast tumors and 15 non-tumoral breast tissues. We identified 19 miRNAs differentially expressed, most of them down-regulated in tumors. An important proportion of deregulated miRNAs in hereditary tumors were previously identified commonly deregulated in sporadic breast tumors. Under-expression of these miRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR in additional 18 sporadic breast tumors and their normal breast tissue counterparts. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that deregulated miRNAs collectively targeted a number of genes belonging to signaling pathways such as MAPK, ErbB, mTOR, and those regulating cell motility or adhesion. In silico prediction detected KRAS oncogene as target of several deregulated miRNAs. In particular, we experimentally validated KRAS as a miR-30c target. Luciferase assays confirmed that miR-30c binds the 3'UTR of KRAS transcripts and expression of pre-miR-30c down-regulated KRAS mRNA and protein. Furthermore, miR-30c overexpression inhibited proliferation of breast cancer cells. Our results identify miRNAs associated to hereditary breast cancer, as well as miRNAs commonly miss-expressed in hereditary and sporadic tumors, suggesting common underlying mechanisms of tumor progression. In addition, we provide evidence that KRAS is a target of miR-30c, and that this miRNA suppresses breast cancer cell growth potentially through inhibition of KRAS signaling.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, Shuangni</author><author>Lu, Zhaohui</author><author>Liu, Changzheng</author><author>Meng, Yunxiao</author><author>Ma, Yihui</author><author>Zhao, Wugan</author><author>Liu, Jianping</author><author>Yu, Jia</author><author>Chen, Jie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>miRNA-96 suppresses KRAS and functions as a tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>6015-25</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20610624</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4531</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Yu et al. - Cancer research - miRNA-96 suppresses KRAS and functions as a tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20610624</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Therapeutic applications of microRNA (miRNA) in KRAS-driven pancreatic cancers might be valuable, but few studies have explored this area.

It is upregulated in several cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PC) and leads to uncontrolled growth and aggressiveness. PC is well known to be a lethal disease with poor prognosis, plagued by limited therapeutic modalities. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are short non-coding RNA molecules, have recently emerged as regulators of signaling networks and have shown potential to target pathway components for therapeutic use in several malignancies. K-Ras mutations are widespread in PC cases (90%), with mutations detectable as early as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias and in later metastatic stages alike; therefore, these mutations in K-Ras are obvious drivers and potential targets for PC therapy. Several K-Ras targeting miRNAs have lately been discovered, and many of them have shown promise in combating pancreatic tumor growth in vitro and in mouse models. However, the field of miRNA therapy is still in its infancy, and miRNA mimics or anti-miRNA oligonucleotides that target Ras pathway have thus far not been evaluated in PC patients. In this review, we summarize the role of several miRNAs that regulate oncogenic K-Ras signaling in PC, with their prospective roles as therapeutic agents for targeting K-Ras pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Minlee</author><author>Kogan, Nicole</author><author>Slack, Frank J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cis-acting elements in its 3' UTR mediate post-transcriptional regulation of KRAS.</title><secondary-title>Oncotarget</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncotarget</full-title></periodical><pages>11770-84</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>3′ UTR</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>miR-185</keyword><keyword>microRNAs (miRNAs)</keyword><keyword>post-transcriptional regulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26930719</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.18632/oncotarget.7599</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Kim, Kogan, Slack - Oncotarget - Cis-acting elements in its 3' UTR mediate post-transcriptional regulation of KRAS.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget%0Awww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26930719</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4914247</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Multiple RNA-binding proteins and non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation through recognition motifs in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of their target genes. The KRAS gene encodes a key signaling protein, and its messenger RNA (mRNA) contains an exceptionally long 3' UTR; this suggests that it may be subject to a highly complex set of regulatory processes. However, 3' UTR-dependent regulation of KRAS expression has not been explored in detail. Using extensive deletion and mutational analyses combined with luciferase reporter assays, we have identified inhibitory and stabilizing cis-acting regions within the KRAS 3' UTR that may interact with miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, such as HuR. Particularly, we have identified an AU-rich 49-nt fragment in the KRAS 3' UTR that is required for KRAS 3' UTR reporter repression. This element contains a miR-185 complementary element, and we show that overexpression of miR-185 represses endogenous KRAS mRNA and protein in vitro. In addition, we have identified another 49-nt fragment that is required to promote KRAS 3' UTR reporter expression. These findings indicate that multiple cis-regulatory motifs in the 3' UTR of KRAS finely modulate its expression, and sequence alterations within a binding motif may disrupt the precise functions of trans-regulatory factors, potentially leading to aberrant KRAS expression.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Neu, Johannes</author><author>Dziunycz, Piotr Jan</author><author>Dzung, Andreas</author><author>Lefort, Karine</author><author>Falke, Martin</author><author>Denzler, Rémy</author><author>Freiberger, Sandra Nicole</author><author>Iotzova-Weiss, Guergana</author><author>Kuzmanov, Aleksandar</author><author>Levesque, Mitchell Paul</author><author>Dotto, Gian-Paolo</author><author>Hofbauer, Günther Franz L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>miR-181a decelerates proliferation in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by targeting the proto-oncogene KRAS.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0185028</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>28931048</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0185028</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Neu et al. - PloS one - miR-181a decelerates proliferation in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by targeting the proto-oncogene K.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185028</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28931048</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5607211</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common human skin cancer with a rapidly increasing incidence among the Caucasian population. Among the many regulators, responsible for cancer progression and growth, microRNAs (miRNA) are generally accepted as key players by now. In our current study we found that microRNA-181a (miR-181a) shows low abundance in SCC compared to normal epidermal skin. In vitro, miRNA downregulation in normal primary keratinocytes induced increased proliferation, while in vivo miR-181a downregulation in HaCaT normal keratinocytes showed tumor-like growth increase up to 50%. Inversely, upregulation of these miRNAs in cancer cells lead to reduced cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis in vitro. An in vivo therapeutic model with induced miR-181a expression in SCC13 cancer cells reduced tumor formation in mice by 80%. Modulation of miR-181a levels showed an inverse correlation with the proto-oncogene KRAS both on mRNA and protein level by direct interaction. Knockdown of KRAS mimicked the anti-proliferative effects of miR-181a overexpression in patient-derived SCC cells and abolished the enhanced viability of HaCaT cells following miR-181a knockdown. Furthermore, phospho-ERK levels correlated with KRAS levels, suggesting that the observed effects were mediated via the MAPK signaling pathway. miR-181a seemed regulated during keratinocyte differentiation probably in order to amplify the tumor suppressive character of differentiation. Taken together, miR-181a plays a crucial tumor suppressive role in SCC by targeting KRAS and could be a promising candidate for a miRNA based therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nakayama, Takuya</author><author>Funakoshi-Tago, Megumi</author><author>Tamura, Hiroomi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coffee reduces KRAS expression in Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells via regulation of miRNAs</title><secondary-title>Oncology Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncology Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>1109-1114</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Caco-2</keyword><keyword>Coffee</keyword><keyword>Colon cancer</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>MiRNA</keyword><keyword>Roasting</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ol.2017.6227</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Nakayama, Funakoshi-Tago, Tamura - Oncology Letters - Coffee reduces KRAS expression in Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells via re.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>© 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved. Previous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colon cancer. To elucidate the molecular basis for this protective action, the effect of coffee on Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells was investigated. Low concentrations of coffee ( &lt; 5%) inhibited proliferation of Caco-2 cells without affecting cell viability. Coffee also reduced KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS) gene expression in a dose-dependent manner; however, caffeine, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, three major constituents of coffee, did not exhibit this effect. Increasing the duration of coffee bean roasting increased the reduction in KRAS expression, suggesting that the active constituents responsible for this effect emerged during the roasting process. MicroRNA (miR) analysis revealed that coffee induced the expression of miR-30c and miR-96, both of which target the KRAS gene. The results of the present study suggested that daily coffee consumption may reduce KRAS activity, thereby preventing the malignant growth of colon carcinoma cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Minlee</author><author>Slack, Frank J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MicroRNA-mediated regulation of KRAS in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Journal of hematology &amp; oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of hematology &amp; oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>84</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Kras</keyword><keyword>Kras-variant</keyword><keyword>Microrna (MIRNA)</keyword><keyword>Rs61764370</keyword><keyword>Rs712</keyword><keyword>Sequence variant</keyword><keyword>Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25433809</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13045-014-0084-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Kim, Slack - Journal of hematology &amp; oncology - MicroRNA-mediated regulation of KRAS in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jhoonline.org/content/7/1/84</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25433809</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4263212</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>While microRNAs (miRNAs) and the KRAS oncogene are known to be dysregulated in various cancers, little is known about the role of miRNAs in the regulation of KRAS in cancer.

Despite having high amino acid identity, KRAS and HRAS have very different codon usage biases: the HRAS gene contains many common codons, and KRAS is enriched for rare codons. Rare codons in KRAS suppress its protein expression, which has been shown to affect both normal and cancer biology in mammals. Here, using HRAS or KRAS expression in different human cell lines and in vitro transcription and translation assays, we show that KRAS rare codons inhibit both translation efficiency and transcription and that the contribution of these two processes varies among different cell lines. We observed that codon usage regulates mRNA translation efficiency such that WT KRAS mRNA is poorly translated. On the other hand, common codons increased transcriptional rates by promoting activating histone modifications and recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Finally, we found that codon usage also influences KRAS protein conformation, likely because of its effect on co-translational protein folding. Together, our results reveal that codon usage has multidimensional effects on protein expression, ranging from effects on transcription to protein folding in human cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fujimura, Ken</author><author>Wang, Huawei</author><author>Watson, Felicia</author><author>Klemke, Richard L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KRAS Oncoprotein Expression Is Regulated by a Self-Governing eIF5A-PEAK1 Feed-Forward Regulatory Loop.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>1444-1456</pages><volume>78</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29321164</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-2873</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Fujimura et al. - Cancer research - KRAS Oncoprotein Expression Is Regulated by a Self-Governing eIF5A-PEAK1 Feed-Forward Regulat.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29321164</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5856625</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>There remains intense interest in tractable approaches to target or silence the KRAS oncoprotein as a rational therapeutic strategy to attack pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and other cancers that overexpress it. Here we provide evidence that accumulation of the KRAS oncoprotein is controlled by a self-regulating feed-forward regulatory loop that utilizes a unique hypusinated isoform of the translation elongation factor eIF5A and the tyrosine kinase PEAK1. Oncogenic activation of KRAS increased eIF5A-PEAK1 translational signaling, which in turn facilitated increased KRAS protein synthesis. Mechanistic investigations show that this feed-forward positive regulatory pathway was controlled by oncogenic KRAS-driven metabolic demands, operated independently of canonical mTOR signaling, and did not involve new KRAS gene transcription. Perturbing eIF5A-PEAK1 signaling, by genetic or pharmacologic strategies or by blocking glutamine synthesis, was sufficient to inhibit expression of KRAS, eIF5A, and PEAK1, to attenuate cancer cell growth and migration, and to block tumor formation in established preclinical mouse models of PDAC. Levels of KRAS, eIF5A, and PEAK1 protein increased during cancer progression with the highest levels of expression observed in metastatic cell populations. Combinatorial targeting of eIF5A hypusination and the RAS-ERK signaling pathway cooperated to attenuate KRAS expression and its downstream signaling along with cell growth in vitro and tumor formation in vivo Collectively, our findings highlight a new mechanistic strategy to attenuate KRAS expression as a therapeutic strategy to target PDAC and other human cancers driven by KRAS activation.Significance: These findings highlight a new mechanistic strategy to attenuate KRAS expression as a therapeutic strategy to target human cancers driven by KRAS activation.

Reversible protein phosphorylation occurs on rapid time-scales (milliseconds to seconds), making it an ideal carrier of these signals. Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics have led to the identification of many tens of thousands of phosphorylation sites, yet for the majority of these the kinase is unknown and the underlying network topology of signaling networks therefore remains obscured. Identifying kinase substrate relationships (KSRs) is therefore an important goal in cell signaling research. Existing consensus sequence motif based prediction algorithms do not consider the biological context of KSRs, and are therefore insensitive to many other mechanisms guiding kinase-substrate recognition in cellular contexts. Here, we use temporal information to identify biologically relevant KSRs from Large-scale In Vivo Experiments (KSR-LIVE) in a data-dependent and automated fashion. First, we used available phosphorylation databases to construct a repository of existing experimentally-predicted KSRs. For each kinase in this database, we used time-resolved phosphoproteomics data to examine how its substrates changed in phosphorylation over time. Although substrates for a particular kinase clustered together, they often exhibited a different temporal pattern to the phosphorylation of the kinase. Therefore, although phosphorylation regulates kinase activity, our findings imply that substrate phosphorylation likely serve as a better proxy for kinase activity than kinase phosphorylation. KSR-LIVE can thereby infer which kinases are regulated within a biological context. Moreover, KSR-LIVE can also be used to automatically generate positive training sets for the subsequent prediction of novel KSRs using machine learning approaches. We demonstrate that this approach can distinguish between Akt and Rps6kb1, two kinases that share the same linear consensus motif, and provide evidence suggesting IRS-1 S265 as a novel Akt site. KSR-LIVE is an open-access algorithm that allows users to dissect phosphorylation signaling within a specific biological context, with the potential to be included in the standard analysis workflow for studying temporal high-throughput signal transduction data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hornbeck, Peter V</author><author>Zhang, Bin</author><author>Murray, Beth</author><author>Kornhauser, Jon M</author><author>Latham, Vaughan</author><author>Skrzypek, Elzbieta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PhosphoSitePlus, 2014: mutations, PTMs and recalibrations.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D512-20</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>Database issue</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1362-4962 (Electronic)\r0305-1048 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>25514926</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gku1267</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Hornbeck et al. - Nucleic acids research - PhosphoSitePlus, 2014 mutations, PTMs and recalibrations.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.proteinatlas.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25514926</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4383998</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>PhosphoSitePlus(®) (PSP, http://www.phosphosite.org/), a knowledgebase dedicated to mammalian post-translational modifications (PTMs), contains over 330,000 non-redundant PTMs, including phospho, acetyl, ubiquityl and methyl groups.

To make this kind of data easily accessible to the public, we have designed and deployed the human metabolic atlas (HMA) website (http://www.metabolicatlas.org). This online resource provides comprehensive information about human metabolism, including the results of metabolic network analyses. We hope that it can also serve as an information exchange interface for human metabolism knowledge within the research community. The HMA consists of three major components: Repository, Hreed (Human REaction Entities Database) and Atlas. Repository is a collection of GEMs for specific human cell types and human-related microorganisms in SBML (System Biology Markup Language) format. The current release consists of several types of GEMs: a generic human GEM, 82 GEMs for normal cell types, 16 GEMs for different cancer cell types, 2 curated GEMs and 5 GEMs for human gut bacteria. Hreed contains detailed information about biochemical reactions. A web interface for Hreed facilitates an access to the Hreed reaction data, which can be easily retrieved by using specific keywords or names of related genes, proteins, compounds and cross-references. Atlas web interface can be used for visualization of the GEMs collection overlaid on KEGG metabolic pathway maps with a zoom/pan user interface. The HMA is a unique tool for studying human metabolism, ranging in scope from an individual cell, to a specific organ, to the overall human body.

It has been proposed that changes in phosphorylation of kinase target sites can be used to infer when a kinase activity is under regulation. However, these approaches have not yet been benchmarked due to a lack of appropriate benchmarking strategies. Results We used curated phosphoproteomic experiments and a gold standard dataset containing a total of 184 kinase-condition pairs where regulation is expected to occur to benchmark and compare different kinase activity inference strategies: Z-test, Kolmogorov Smirnov test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and a multiple linear regression model. We also tested weighted variants of the Z-test and GSEA that include information on kinase sequence specificity as proxy for affinity. Finally, we tested how the number of known substrates and the type of evidence ( in vivo , in vitro or in silico ) supporting these influence the predictions. Conclusions Most models performed well with the Z-test and the GSEA performing best as determined by the area under the ROC curve (Mean AUC = 0.722). Weighting kinase targets by the kinase target sequence preference improves the results marginally. However, the number of known substrates and the evidence supporting the interactions has a strong effect on the predictions.

However, these assays have generally not taken advantage of sample multiplexing, which allows up to ten analyses to occur in parallel. We present a two-dimensional multiplexing workflow that utilizes synthetic peptides for each protein to prompt the simultaneous quantification of &gt;100 peptides from up to ten mixed sample conditions. We demonstrate that targeted analysis of unfractionated lysates (2 hr) accurately reproduces the quantification of fractionated lysates (72 hr analysis) while obviating the need for peptide detection prior to quantification. We targeted 131 peptides corresponding to 69 proteins across all 60 National Cancer Institute cell lines in biological triplicate, analyzing 180 samples in only 48 hr (the equivalent of 16 min/sample). These data further elucidated a correlation between the expression of key proteins and their cellular response to drug treatment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, Hung</author><author>Shrestha, Sangam</author><author>Tran, Duc</author><author>Shafi, Adib</author><author>Draghici, Sorin</author><author>Nguyen, Tin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Comprehensive Survey of Tools and Software for Active Subnetwork Identification</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Genetics</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>March</issue><keywords><keyword>PPI network</keyword><keyword>active module</keyword><keyword>active subnetwork</keyword><keyword>data integration</keyword><keyword>network</keyword><keyword>network analysis</keyword><keyword>ppi network</keyword><keyword>subnetwork identification</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fgene.2019.00155</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Nguyen et al. - Frontiers in Genetics - A Comprehensive Survey of Tools and Software for Active Subnetwork Identification.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2019.00155/full</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Terakawa, Jumpei</author><author>Serna, Vanida Ann</author><author>Taketo, Makoto Mark</author><author>Daikoku, Takiko</author><author>Suarez, Adrian A</author><author>Kurita, Takeshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ovarian insufficiency and CTNNB1 mutations drive malignant transformation of endometrial hyperplasia with altered PTEN/PI3K activities.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>201814506</pages><keywords><keyword>estrogen</keyword><keyword>menopause</keyword><keyword>metastasis</keyword><keyword>myometrial invasion</keyword><keyword>progesterone</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30782821</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1814506116</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Terakawa et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Ovarian insufficiency and CTN.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1814506116</url><url>http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1814506116</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782821</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (EECs) carry multiple driver mutations even when they are low grade. However, the biological significance of these concurrent mutations is unknown. We explored the interactions among three signature EEC mutations: loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in PTEN, gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, utilizing in vivo mutagenesis of the mouse uterine epithelium. While epithelial cells with a monoallelic mutation in any one of three genes failed to propagate in the endometrium, any combination of two or more mutant alleles promoted the growth of epithelium, causing simple hyperplasia, in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, Ctnnb1 exon 3 deletion significantly increased the size of hyperplastic lesions by promoting the growth of PTEN LOF and/or PI3K GOF mutant cells through the activation of neoadenogenesis pathways. Although these three mutations were insufficient to cause EEC in intact female mice, castration triggered malignant transformation, leading to myometrial invasion and serosal metastasis. Treatment of castrated mice with progesterone or estradiol attenuated the neoplastic transformation. This study demonstrates that multiple driver mutations are required for premalignant cells to break the growth-repressing field effect of normal endometrium maintained by ovarian steroids and that CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations play critical roles in the growth of preneoplastic cells within the endometrium of premenopausal women and in the myometrial invasion of EECs in menopausal women.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Chih-Shia</author><author>Lee, Liam C</author><author>Yuan, Tina L</author><author>Chakka, Sirisha</author><author>Fellmann, Christof</author><author>Lowe, Scott W</author><author>Caplen, Natasha J</author><author>McCormick, Frank</author><author>Luo, Ji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MAP kinase and autophagy pathways cooperate to maintain RAS mutant cancer cell survival.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>201817494</pages><keywords><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>MAPK</keyword><keyword>RAF</keyword><keyword>autophagy</keyword><keyword>siRNA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30709910</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1817494116</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Lee et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - MAP kinase and autophagy pathways.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1817494116</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30709910</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Oncogenic mutations in the small GTPase KRAS are frequently found in human cancers, and, currently, there are no effective targeted therapies for these tumors. Using a combinatorial siRNA approach, we analyzed a panel of KRAS mutant colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell lines for their dependency on 28 gene nodes that represent canonical RAS effector pathways and selected stress response pathways. We found that RAF node knockdown best differentiated KRAS mutant and KRAS WT cancer cells, suggesting RAF kinases are key oncoeffectors for KRAS addiction. By analyzing all 376 pairwise combination of these gene nodes, we found that cotargeting the RAF, RAC, and autophagy pathways can improve the capture of KRAS dependency better than targeting RAF alone. In particular, codepletion of the oncoeffector kinases BRAF and CRAF, together with the autophagy E1 ligase ATG7, gives the best therapeutic window between KRAS mutant cells and normal, untransformed cells. Distinct patterns of RAS effector dependency were observed across KRAS mutant cell lines, indicative of heterogeneous utilization of effector and stress response pathways in supporting KRAS addiction. Our findings revealed previously unappreciated complexity in the signaling network downstream of the KRAS oncogene and suggest rational target combinations for more effective therapeutic intervention.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barber, Karl W</author><author>Elledge, Stephen J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sequencer Hacking Unlocks Quantitative Protein Studies.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cell</full-title></periodical><pages>863-865</pages><volume>73</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><accession-num>30849392</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molcel.2019.01.039</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Barber, Elledge - Molecular cell - Sequencer Hacking Unlocks Quantitative Protein Studies.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30849392</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this issue of Molecular Cell, Layton et al.

Over a short span of two decades, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which VEGF coordinates neurovascular homeostasis has become more sophisticated. The central role of VEGF in the pathogenesis of diverse cancers and blinding eye diseases has also become evident. Elucidation of the molecular regulation of VEGF and the transformative development of multiple therapeutic pathways targeting VEGF directly or indirectly is a powerful case study of how fundamental research can guide innovation and translation. It is also an elegant example of how agnostic discovery and can transform our understanding of human disease. This review will highlight critical nodal points in VEGF biology, including recent developments in immunotherapy for cancer and multitarget approaches in neovascular eye disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Razi, Abolfazl</author><author>Afghah, Fatemeh</author><author>Singh, Salendra</author><author>Varadan, Vinay</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Network-Based Enriched Gene Subnetwork Identification: A Game-Theoretic Approach.</title><secondary-title>Biomedical engineering and computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomedical engineering and computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>Suppl 2</issue><keywords><keyword>cancer genomics</keyword><keyword>clinical outcome prediction</keyword><keyword>coalition game theory</keyword><keyword>modulated subnetworks</keyword><keyword>network traversal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27081328</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4137/BECB.S38244</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Razi et al. - Biomedical engineering and computational biology - Network-Based Enriched Gene Subnetwork Identification A Game-The.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/BECB.S38244</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27081328</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4822726</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Identifying subsets of genes that jointly mediate cancer etiology, progression, or therapy response remains a challenging problem due to the complexity and heterogeneity in cancer biology, a problem further exacerbated by the relatively small number of cancer samples profiled as compared with the sheer number of potential molecular factors involved. Pure data-driven methods that merely rely on multiomics data have been successful in discovering potentially functional genes but suffer from high false-positive rates and tend to report subsets of genes whose biological interrelationships are unclear. Recently, integrative data-driven models have been developed to integrate multiomics data with signaling pathway networks in order to identify pathways associated with clinical or biological phenotypes. However, these approaches suffer from an important drawback of being restricted to previously discovered pathway structures and miss novel genomic interactions as well as potential crosstalk among the pathways. In this article, we propose a novel coalition-based game-theoretic approach to overcome the challenge of identifying biologically relevant gene subnetworks associated with disease phenotypes. The algorithm starts from a set of seed genes and traverses a protein-protein interaction network to identify modulated subnetworks. The optimal set of modulated subnetworks is identified using Shapley value that accounts for both individual and collective utility of the subnetwork of genes. The algorithm is applied to two illustrative applications, including the identification of subnetworks associated with (i) disease progression risk in response to platinum-based therapy in ovarian cancer and (ii) immune infiltration in triple-negative breast cancer. The results demonstrate an improved predictive power of the proposed method when compared with state-of-the-art feature selection methods, with the added advantage of identifying novel potentially functional gene subnetworks that may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying cancer progression.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cristopher V Van Hout, Ioanna Tachmazidou, Joshua D Backman, Joshua X Hoffman, Bin Yi, Ashutosh Pandey, Claudia Gonzaga-Jauregui, Shareef Khalid, Daren Liu, Nilanjana Banerjee, Alexander H Li, Colm O'Dushlaine, Anthony Marcketta, Jeffrey Staples, Claudia, Aris Baras</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Whole exome sequencing and characterization of coding variation in 49,960 individuals in the UK Biobank</title><secondary-title>Biomedical Engineering and Computational Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biomedical Engineering and Computational Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>BECB.S38244</pages><volume>7s2</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>doi.org/10.1101/572347</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Cristopher V Van Hout, Ioanna Tachmazidou, Joshua D Backman, Joshua X Hoffman, Bin Yi, Ashutosh Pandey, Claudia Gonzaga-Jauregui,.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/572347</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The UK Biobank is a prospective study of 502,543 individuals, combining extensive phenotypic and genotypic data with streamlined access for researchers around the world. Here we describe the first tranche of large-scale exome sequence data for 49,960 study participants, revealing approximately 4 million coding variants (of which ~98.4% have frequency &lt; 1%). The data includes 231,631 predicted loss of function variants, a &gt;10-fold increase compared to imputed sequence for the same participants. Nearly all genes (&gt;97%) had ≥1 predicted loss of function carrier, and most genes (&gt;69%) had ≥10 loss of function carriers. We illustrate the power of characterizing loss of function variation in this large population through association analyses across 1,741 phenotypes. In addition to replicating a range of established associations, we discover novel loss of function variants with large effects on disease traits, including PIEZO1 on varicose veins, COL6A1 on corneal resistance, MEPE on bone density, and IQGAP2 and GMPR on blood cell traits. We further demonstrate the value of exome sequencing by surveying the prevalence of pathogenic variants of clinical significance in this population, finding that 2% of the population has a medically actionable variant. Additionally, we leverage the phenotypic data to characterize the relationship between rare BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants and cancer risk. Exomes from the first 49,960 participants are now made accessible to the scientific community and highlight the promise offered by genomic sequencing in large-scale population-based studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liben-Nowell, David</author><author>Kleinberg, Jon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The link prediction problem for social networks</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the twelfth international conference on Information and knowledge management - CIKM '03</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the twelfth international conference on Information and knowledge management - CIKM '03</full-title></periodical><pages>556</pages><keywords><keyword>G22 [Graph Theory]: Network Problems</keyword><keyword>General Terms Algorithms Keywords Social networks</keyword><keyword>J4 [Social and Be-havioral Sciences]: Sociology</keyword><keyword>link analysis</keyword><keyword>link prediction Categories and Subject Descriptors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><pub-location>New York, New York, USA</pub-location><publisher>ACM Press</publisher><isbn>1581137230</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/956863.956972</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2003 - Liben-Nowell, Kleinberg - Proceedings of the twelfth international conference on Information and knowledge management - CIKM '03.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/960000/956972/p556-liben-nowell.pdf?ip=128.103.224.7&amp;id=956972&amp;acc=ACTIVE SERVICE&amp;key=AA86BE8B6928DDC7.C82FBC3DCC335AD2.4D4702B0C3E38B35.4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;__acm__=1552251539_95468f6d17c9e57e0b25d959501ad20a</url><url>http://portal.acm</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Given a snapshot of a social network, can we infer which new interactions among its members are likely to occur in the near future?

The new tags are designed to ensure that identical peptides labeled with different TMTs exactly comigrate in all separations. The tags require novel methods of quantification analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. The new tags and analysis methods allow peptides from different samples to be identified by their relative abundance with greater ease and accuracy than other methods. The new TMTs permit simultaneous determination of both the identity and relative abundances of peptide pairs using a collision induced dissociation (CID)-based analysis method. Relative abundance measurements made in the MS/MS mode using the new tags are accurate and sensitive. Compared to MS-mode measurements, a very high signal-to-noise ratio is achieved with MS/MS based detection.

The graph is derived from a relational database that links products, consumers, and attributes such as product categories, consumer demographics, market segments, etc. The Markov chain that describes this walk amalgamates consumer behavior over the whole population; individuals are distinguished by their current state in the chain. We develop a geometrization of the chain that furnishes a key similarity measure for information retrieval--the cosine (correlation) angle between two states. Empirically, this proves to be highly predictive of future choices made by individuals, and is useful for recommending and semi-supervised classification. This statistic is obtained through a sparse matrix inversion, and we develop approximation strategies that make this practical for very large Markov chains. These methods also make it practical to compute recommendations to maximize long-term profit.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>von Luxburg, Ulrike</author><author>Radl, Agnes</author><author>Hein, Matthias</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hitting and commute times in large graphs are often misleading</title><secondary-title>Journal of Machine Learning Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Machine Learning Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1751-1798</pages><volume>15</volume><keywords><keyword>commute distance</keyword><keyword>k-nearest neighbor graph</keyword><keyword>random graph</keyword><keyword>resistance</keyword><keyword>spec-tral gap</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1532-4435</isbn><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - von Luxburg, Radl, Hein - Journal of Machine Learning Research - Hitting and commute times in large graphs are often misleading.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume15/vonluxburg14a/vonluxburg14a.pdf</url><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1266</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Next to the shortest path distance, the second most popular distance function between vertices in a graph is the commute distance (resistance distance). For two vertices u and v, the hitting time H_{uv} is the expected time it takes a random walk to travel from u to v. The commute time is its symmetrized version C_{uv} = H_{uv} + H_{vu}. In our paper we study the behavior of hitting times and commute distances when the number n of vertices in the graph is very large. We prove that as n converges to infinty, hitting times and commute distances converge to expressions that do not take into account the global structure of the graph at all. Namely, the hitting time H_{uv} converges to 1/d_v and the commute time to 1/d_u + 1/d_v where d_u and d_v denote the degrees of vertices u and v. In these cases, the hitting and commute times are misleading in the sense that they do not provide information about the structure of the graph. We focus on two major classes of random graphs: random geometric graphs (k-nearest neighbor graphs, epsilon-graphs, Gaussian similarity graphs) and random graphs with given expected degrees (in particular, Erdos-Renyi graphs with and without planted partitions)</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eraslan, Basak</author><author>Wang, Dongxue</author><author>Gusic, Mirjana</author><author>Prokisch, Holger</author><author>Hallström, Björn M</author><author>Uhlén, Mathias</author><author>Asplund, Anna</author><author>Pontén, Frederik</author><author>Wieland, Thomas</author><author>Hopf, Thomas</author><author>Hahne, Hannes</author><author>Kuster, Bernhard</author><author>Gagneur, Julien</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantification and discovery of sequence determinants of protein-per-mRNA amount in 29 human tissues.</title><secondary-title>Molecular systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e8513</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>codon usage</keyword><keyword>mRNA sequence motifs</keyword><keyword>proteomics</keyword><keyword>transcriptomics</keyword><keyword>translational control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>4981619762892</isbn><accession-num>30777893</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.15252/msb.20188513</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Eraslan et al. - Molecular systems biology - Quantification and discovery of sequence determinants of protein-per-mRNA amount in.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://msb.embopress.org/content/msb/15/2/e8513.full.pdf</url><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/27/353763?%3Fcollection=</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777893</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6379048</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Despite their importance in determining protein abundance, a comprehensive catalogue of sequence features controlling protein-to-mRNA (PTR) ratios and a quantification of their effects are still lacking. Here, we quantified PTR ratios for 11,575 proteins across 29 human tissues using matched transcriptomes and proteomes. We estimated by regression the contribution of known sequence determinants of protein synthesis and degradation in addition to 45 mRNA and 3 protein sequence motifs that we found by association testing. While PTR ratios span more than 2 orders of magnitude, our integrative model predicts PTR ratios at a median precision of 3.2-fold. A reporter assay provided functional support for two novel UTR motifs, and an immobilized mRNA affinity competition-binding assay identified motif-specific bound proteins for one motif. Moreover, our integrative model led to a new metric of codon optimality that captures the effects of codon frequency on protein synthesis and degradation. Altogether, this study shows that a large fraction of PTR ratio variation in human tissues can be predicted from sequence, and it identifies many new candidate post-transcriptional regulatory elements.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blohm, Philipp</author><author>Frishman, Goar</author><author>Smialowski, Pawel</author><author>Goebels, Florian</author><author>Wachinger, Benedikt</author><author>Ruepp, Andreas</author><author>Frishman, Dmitrij</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Negatome 2.0: a database of non-interacting proteins derived by literature mining, manual annotation and protein structure analysis.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D396-400</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>Database issue</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24214996</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkt1079</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Blohm et al. - Nucleic acids research - Negatome 2.0 a database of non-interacting proteins derived by literature mining, manual.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://2013.bionlp-st.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24214996</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3965096</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Knowledge about non-interacting proteins (NIPs) is important for training the algorithms to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and for assessing the false positive rates of PPI detection efforts. We present the second version of Negatome, a database of proteins and protein domains that are unlikely to engage in physical interactions (available online at http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/ppi/negatome). Negatome is derived by manual curation of literature and by analyzing three-dimensional structures of protein complexes. The main methodological innovation in Negatome 2.0 is the utilization of an advanced text mining procedure to guide the manual annotation process. Potential non-interactions were identified by a modified version of Excerbt, a text mining tool based on semantic sentence analysis. Manual verification shows that nearly a half of the text mining results with the highest confidence values correspond to NIP pairs. Compared to the first version the contents of the database have grown by over 300%.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Basha, Omer</author><author>Barshir, Ruth</author><author>Sharon, Moran</author><author>Lerman, Eugene</author><author>Kirson, Binyamin F</author><author>Hekselman, Idan</author><author>Yeger-Lotem, Esti</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The TissueNet v.2 database: A quantitative view of protein-protein interactions across human tissues.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D427-D431</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>D1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>27899616</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkw1088</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Basha et al. - Nucleic acids research - The TissueNet v.2 database A quantitative view of protein-protein interactions across hum.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/tissuenet.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899616</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5210565</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Knowledge of the molecular interactions of human proteins within tissues is important for identifying their tissue-specific roles and for shedding light on tissue phenotypes. However, many protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have no tissue-contexts. The TissueNet database bridges this gap by associating experimentally-identified PPIs with human tissues that were shown to express both pair-mates. Users can select a protein and a tissue, and obtain a network view of the query protein and its tissue-associated PPIs. TissueNet v.2 is an updated version of the TissueNet database previously featured in NAR. It includes over 40 human tissues profiled via RNA-sequencing or protein-based assays. Users can select their preferred expression data source and interactively set the expression threshold for determining tissue-association. The output of TissueNet v.2 emphasizes qualitative and quantitative features of query proteins and their PPIs. The tissue-specificity view highlights tissue-specific and globally-expressed proteins, and the quantitative view highlights proteins that were differentially expressed in the selected tissue relative to all other tissues. Together, these views allow users to quickly assess the unique versus global functionality of query proteins. Thus, TissueNet v.2 offers an extensive, quantitative and user-friendly interface to study the roles of human proteins across tissues. TissueNet v.2 is available at http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/tissuenet.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sjöblom, Tobias</author><author>Jones, Siân</author><author>Wood, Laura D</author><author>Parsons, D Williams</author><author>Lin, Jimmy</author><author>Barber, Thomas D</author><author>Mandelker, Diana</author><author>Leary, Rebecca J</author><author>Ptak, Janine</author><author>Silliman, Natalie</author><author>Szabo, Steve</author><author>Buckhaults, Phillip</author><author>Farrell, Christopher</author><author>Meeh, Paul</author><author>Markowitz, Sanford D</author><author>Willis, Joseph</author><author>Dawson, Dawn</author><author>Willson, James K V</author><author>Gazdar, Adi F</author><author>Hartigan, James</author><author>Wu, Leo</author><author>Liu, Changsheng</author><author>Parmigiani, Giovanni</author><author>Park, Ben Ho</author><author>Bachman, Kurtis E</author><author>Papadopoulos, Nickolas</author><author>Vogelstein, Bert</author><author>Kinzler, Kenneth W</author><author>Velculescu, Victor E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The consensus coding sequences of human breast and colorectal cancers.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>268-74</pages><volume>314</volume><issue>5797</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16959974</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1133427</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2006 - Sjöblom et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - The consensus coding sequences of human breast and colorectal cancers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16959974</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The elucidation of the human genome sequence has made it possible to identify genetic alterations in cancers in unprecedented detail. To begin a systematic analysis of such alterations, we determined the sequence of well-annotated human protein-coding genes in two common tumor types. Analysis of 13,023 genes in 11 breast and 11 colorectal cancers revealed that individual tumors accumulate an average of approximately 90 mutant genes but that only a subset of these contribute to the neoplastic process. Using stringent criteria to delineate this subset, we identified 189 genes (average of 11 per tumor) that were mutated at significant frequency. The vast majority of these genes were not known to be genetically altered in tumors and are predicted to affect a wide range of cellular functions, including transcription, adhesion, and invasion. These data define the genetic landscape of two human cancer types, provide new targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention, and open fertile avenues for basic research in tumor biology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ding, Li</author><author>Raphael, Benjamin J</author><author>Chen, Feng</author><author>Wendl, Michael C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Advances for studying clonal evolution in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cancer letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer letters</full-title></periodical><pages>212-9</pages><volume>340</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Clonal evolution</keyword><keyword>Tumor heterogeneity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1872-7980 (Electronic)\r0304-3835 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>23353056</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.canlet.2012.12.028</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Ding et al. - Cancer letters - Advances for studying clonal evolution in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2012.12.028</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23353056</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3783624</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The &quot;clonal evolution&quot; model of cancer emerged and &quot;evolved&quot; amid ongoing advances in technology, especially in recent years during which next generation sequencing instruments have provided ever higher resolution pictures of the genetic changes in cancer cells and heterogeneity in tumors. It has become increasingly clear that clonal evolution is not a single sequential process, but instead frequently involves simultaneous evolution of multiple subclones that co-exist because they are of similar fitness or are spatially separated. Co-evolution of subclones also occurs when they complement each other's survival advantages. Recent studies have also shown that clonal evolution is highly heterogeneous: different individual tumors of the same type may undergo very different paths of clonal evolution. New methodological advancements, including deep digital sequencing of a mixed tumor population, single cell sequencing, and the development of more sophisticated computational tools, will continue to shape and reshape the models of clonal evolution. In turn, these will provide both an improved framework for the understanding of cancer progression and a guide for treatment strategies aimed at the elimination of all, rather than just some, of the cancer cells within a patient.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Hailiang</author><author>Zhang, Lan V</author><author>Roth, Frederick P</author><author>Bader, Joel S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Probabilistic Paths for Protein Complex Inference</title><secondary-title>Systems Biology and Computational Proteomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Systems Biology and Computational Proteomics</full-title></periodical><pages>14-28</pages><volume>4532</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-540-73060-6_2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Huang et al. - Systems Biology and Computational Proteomics - Probabilistic Paths for Protein Complex Inference.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-73060-6_2.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Understanding how individual proteins are organized into complexes and pathways is a significant current challenge. We introduce new algorithms to infer protein complexes by combining seed proteins with a confidence-weighted network. Two new stochastic methods use averaging over a probabil-istic ensemble of networks, and the new deterministic method provides a deterministic ranking of prospective complex members. We compare the per-formance of these algorithms with three existing algorithms. We test algorithm performance using three weighted graphs: a naïve Bayes estimate of the prob-ability of a direct and stable protein-protein interaction; a logistic regression es-timate of the probability of a direct or indirect interaction; and a decision tree estimate of whether two proteins exist within a common protein complex. The best-performing algorithms in these trials are the new stochastic methods. The deterministic algorithm is significantly faster, whereas the stochastic algorithms are less sensitive to the weighting scheme.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Steven M</author><author>Grosshans, Helge</author><author>Shingara, Jaclyn</author><author>Byrom, Mike</author><author>Jarvis, Rich</author><author>Cheng, Angie</author><author>Labourier, Emmanuel</author><author>Reinert, Kristy L</author><author>Brown, David</author><author>Slack, Frank J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RAS is regulated by the let-7 microRNA family.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>635-47</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><publisher>Slack</publisher><accession-num>15766527</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.014</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2005 - Johnson et al. - Cell - RAS is regulated by the let-7 microRNA family.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0092867405000887/1-s2.0-S0092867405000887-main.pdf?_tid=67612c3f-015a-4125-8a10-a81b85d6776e&amp;acdnat=1551877198_2976ef50115a122ebf269c7776a20c14</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15766527</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:3prime</label><abstract>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory RNAs found in multicellular eukaryotes, including humans, where they are implicated in cancer.

The latest release, COSMIC v86 (August 2018), includes almost 6 million coding mutations across 1.4 million tumour samples, curated from over 26 000 publications. In addition to coding mutations, COSMIC covers all the genetic mechanisms by which somatic mutations promote cancer, including non-coding mutations, gene fusions, copy-number variants and drug-resistance mutations. COSMIC is primarily hand-curated, ensuring quality, accuracy and descriptive data capture. Building on our manual curation processes, we are introducing new initiatives that allow us to prioritize key genes and diseases, and to react more quickly and comprehensively to new findings in the literature. Alongside improvements to the public website and data-download systems, new functionality in COSMIC-3D allows exploration of mutations within three-dimensional protein structures, their protein structural and functional impacts, and implications for druggability. In parallel with COSMIC's deep and broad variant coverage, the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) describes a curated catalogue of genes driving every form of human cancer. Currently describing 719 genes, the CGC has recently introduced functional descriptions of how each gene drives disease, summarized into the 10 cancer Hallmarks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hanahan, Douglas</author><author>Weinberg, Robert A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>646-74</pages><volume>144</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1097-4172 (Electronic)\r0092-8674 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21376230</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Hanahan, Weinberg - Cell - Hallmarks of cancer the next generation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2811%2900127-9</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21376230</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the &quot;tumor microenvironment.&quot; Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cao, Junyue</author><author>Spielmann, Malte</author><author>Qiu, Xiaojie</author><author>Huang, Xingfan</author><author>Ibrahim, Daniel M</author><author>Hill, Andrew J</author><author>Zhang, Fan</author><author>Mundlos, Stefan</author><author>Christiansen, Lena</author><author>Steemers, Frank J</author><author>Trapnell, Cole</author><author>Shendure, Jay</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The single-cell transcriptional landscape of mammalian organogenesis.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>496-502</pages><volume>566</volume><issue>7745</issue><keywords><keyword>C-Raf</keyword><keyword>M-Ras</keyword><keyword>Noonan syndrome</keyword><keyword>Shoc2</keyword><keyword>collective cell migration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30787437</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41586-019-0969-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Cao et al. - Nature - The single-cell transcriptional landscape of mammalian organogenesis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-0969-x</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30808747</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30787437</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mammalian organogenesis is a remarkable process. Within a short timeframe, the cells of the three germ layers transform into an embryo that includes most of the major internal and external organs. Here we investigate the transcriptional dynamics of mouse organogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing, we profiled the transcriptomes of around 2 million cells derived from 61 embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation, in a single experiment. The resulting 'mouse organogenesis cell atlas' (MOCA) provides a global view of developmental processes during this critical window. We use Monocle 3 to identify hundreds of cell types and 56 trajectories, many of which are detected only because of the depth of cellular coverage, and collectively define thousands of corresponding marker genes. We explore the dynamics of gene expression within cell types and trajectories over time, including focused analyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kota, Pradeep</author><author>Terrell, Elizabeth M</author><author>Ritt, Daniel A</author><author>Insinna, Christine</author><author>Westlake, Christopher J</author><author>Morrison, Deborah K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>M-Ras/Shoc2 signaling modulates E-cadherin turnover and cell-cell adhesion during collective cell migration.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>3536-3545</pages><volume>116</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>C-Raf</keyword><keyword>M-Ras</keyword><keyword>Noonan syndrome</keyword><keyword>Shoc2</keyword><keyword>collective cell migration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30808747</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1805919116</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Kota et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - M-RasShoc2 signaling modulates E-.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1805919116</url><url>http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1805919116</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30808747</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Collective cell migration is required for normal embryonic development and contributes to various biological processes, including wound healing and cancer cell invasion. The M-Ras GTPase and its effector, the Shoc2 scaffold, are proteins mutated in the developmental RASopathy Noonan syndrome, and, here, we report that activated M-Ras recruits Shoc2 to cell surface junctions where M-Ras/Shoc2 signaling contributes to the dynamic regulation of cell-cell junction turnover required for collective cell migration. MCF10A cells expressing the dominant-inhibitory M-RasS27N variant or those lacking Shoc2 exhibited reduced junction turnover and were unable to migrate effectively as a group. Through further depletion/reconstitution studies, we found that M-Ras/Shoc2 signaling contributes to junction turnover by modulating the E-cadherin/p120-catenin interaction and, in turn, the junctional expression of E-cadherin. The regulatory effect of the M-Ras/Shoc2 complex was mediated at least in part through the phosphoregulation of p120-catenin and required downstream ERK cascade activation. Strikingly, cells rescued with the Noonan-associated, myristoylated-Shoc2 mutant (Myr-Shoc2) displayed a gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype, with the cells exhibiting increased junction turnover and reduced E-cadherin/p120-catenin binding and migrating as a faster but less cohesive group. Consistent with these results, Noonan-associated C-Raf mutants that bypass the need for M-Ras/Shoc2 signaling exhibited a similar GOF phenotype when expressed in Shoc2-depleted MCF10A cells. Finally, expression of the Noonan-associated Myr-Shoc2 or C-Raf mutants, but not their WT counterparts, induced gastrulation defects indicative of aberrant cell migration in zebrafish embryos, further demonstrating the function of the M-Ras/Shoc2/ERK cascade signaling axis in the dynamic control of coordinated cell movement.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jia, Dongya</author><author>Lu, Mingyang</author><author>Jung, Kwang Hwa</author><author>Park, Jun Hyoung</author><author>Yu, Linglin</author><author>Onuchic, José N</author><author>Kaipparettu, Benny Abraham</author><author>Levine, Herbert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Elucidating cancer metabolic plasticity by coupling gene regulation with metabolic pathways.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>3909-3918</pages><volume>116</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>OXPHOS</keyword><keyword>TNBC</keyword><keyword>Warburg</keyword><keyword>hybrid</keyword><keyword>metabolic reprogramming</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30733294</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1816391116</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Jia et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Elucidating cancer metabolic plast.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/9/3909.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733294</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Metabolic plasticity enables cancer cells to switch their metabolism phenotypes between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, it is still largely unknown how cancer cells orchestrate gene regulation to balance their glycolysis and OXPHOS activities. Previously, by modeling the gene regulation of cancer metabolism we have reported that cancer cells can acquire a stable hybrid metabolic state in which both glycolysis and OXPHOS can be used. Here, to comprehensively characterize cancer metabolic activity, we establish a theoretical framework by coupling gene regulation with metabolic pathways. Our modeling results demonstrate a direct association between the activities of AMPK and HIF-1, master regulators of OXPHOS and glycolysis, respectively, with the activities of three major metabolic pathways: glucose oxidation, glycolysis, and fatty acid oxidation. Our model further characterizes the hybrid metabolic state and a metabolically inactive state where cells have low activity of both glycolysis and OXPHOS. We verify the model prediction using metabolomics and transcriptomics data from paired tumor and adjacent benign tissue samples from a cohort of breast cancer patients and RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We further validate the model prediction by in vitro studies of aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The experimental results confirm that TNBC cells can maintain a hybrid metabolic phenotype and targeting both glycolysis and OXPHOS is necessary to eliminate their metabolic plasticity. In summary, our work serves as a platform to symmetrically study how tuning gene activity modulates metabolic pathway activity, and vice versa.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Engeland, M.</author><author>Weijenberg, Matty P</author><author>Nallur, Sunitha</author><author>Paranjape, Trupti</author><author>Schouten, Leo J</author><author>Smits, Kim M</author><author>van den Brandt, P.

Tumor-node-metastasis-system stage is currently used to guide therapy decisions but lacks precision. Prognostic biomarkers are needed to refine stratification of patients for chemotherapy but validated biomarkers are not yet available. Recently, a SNP in a lethal-7 (let-7) miRNA complementary site (LCS6) in the KRAS 3 0 untranslated region was suggested to affect survival in metastatic CRC. Effects in early-stage CRC are however unknown. We studied KRAS-LCS6 genotype, hypothesizing that it might identify early-stage cases with a poor prognosis, and could potentially be used in therapy decision-making. Experimental Design: We studied 409 early stage, 182 stage III, and 69 stage IV cases, and 1,886 subcohort members from the Netherlands Cohort Study. KRAS-LCS6 genotype was assessed with TaqMan PCR. Kaplan-Meier analyses or Cox regression were used to assess associations between genotype and CRC risk or cause-specific survival. Results: Early-stage cases with the KRAS-LCS6 variant had a lower CRC risk (incidence-rate ratio 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49-0.94) and a better survival (log-rank P ¼ 0.038; HR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.18-1.14). In patients with KRAS-mutated CRC carrying the KRAS-LCS6 variant, the better outcome was enhanced as no patients died of CRC (log-rank P ¼ 0.017). In advanced patients, no clear association between genotype and CRC risk or survival was observed. Conclusions: Our results indicate that early-stage CRC cases with the KRAS-LCS6 variant have a better outcome. In advanced disease, the better outcome no longer exists. For early-stage patients, KRAS-LCS6 genotype combined with KRAS mutations merits validation as a prognostic biomarker and consideration in therapy decision-making. Clin Cancer Res; 17(24); 7723-31.

However, results from an increasing number of studies concerning the association of Kras gene rs712 and rs61764370 polymorphisms with risk of cancer and treatment of mCRC using anti-EGFR remain equivocal. METHODS Risk associations were evaluated in 1,661 cases and 2,139 controls from six studies concerning rs712 and 14,796 cases and 14,985 controls from 29 studies concerning rs61764370. Response association was also examined in a subset of four studies pertaining to rs61764370 and anti-EGFR treatment in mCRC. RESULTS Results of a meta-analysis showed that allele T (P-value of heterogeneity test [P H] =0.08, odds ratio [OR] =1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.64) and genotype GT/TT (P H=0.14, OR =1.30, 95% CI: 1.10-1.55) in rs712 were strongly associated with cancer in Chinese subjects. No evidence of association was observed between rs712 and risk of cancer in the overall population or between rs61764370 and ovarian, breast, colorectal, or non-small-cell lung cancer risk in the Caucasian population. No significant association was found between rs61764370 and patient response to anti-EGFR therapy in mCRC. CONCLUSION The findings not only provide further evidence that allele T of rs712 increases genetic predisposition to cancer in Chinese population, but also no significant association between rs61764370 and cancer risk in Caucasian population, and suggest that genotype GT/TT of rs61764370 may not be a biomarker for predicting clinical outcome of anti-EGFR therapy in mCRC.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Egeli, Unal</author><author>Ak, Secil</author><author>Cecener, Gulsah</author><author>Tunca, Berrin</author><author>Tezcan, Gulcin</author><author>Sevinc, Elif Demirdogen</author><author>Kaya, Ekrem</author><author>Dundar, Halit Ziya</author><author>Sarkut, Pinar</author><author>Ozen, Yilmaz</author><author>Balcin, Ozkan</author><author>Evrensel, Turkkan</author><author>Yerci, Omer</author><author>Ugras, Nesrin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of 3'UTR variation patterns of the KRAS gene on the aggressiveness of pancreatobiliary tumors with the KRAS G13D mutation in a Turkish population.</title><secondary-title>Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

However, limited data exist on the clinical effect of these alterations. The aim of the current study was to clarify the frequency of relevant alterations of the 3'UTR regions of the KRAS gene and the effect of KRAS 3'UTR polymorphisms on the prognosis of patients with codon 12, 13 and 61 mutations in a Turkish population with PBT. METHODS Codons 12, 13, and 61 and 3'UTRs of the KRAS gene were screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing in 43 patients and 10 controls. Chi-squared and independent sample T tests were used to evaluate the results of the mutation analysis and clinical features of the patients. RESULTS We defined the c.38G &gt; A (rs112445441, p.G13D) (39.54%) mutation and two 3'UTR variations, c.*4066delA (rs560890523) (23.26%) and c.*4065_*4066delAA (rs57698689) (6.98%), in the KRAS gene of Turkish patients. There was a statistically significant relationship between the c.*4066delA (rs560890523) and c.*4065_*4066delAA (rs57698689) variations and invasion and lymph node metastasis status of the patients (p &lt; 0.001). Compared to patients with c.38G &gt; A (rs112445441, p.G13D), patients with c.*4066delA (rs560890523) and c.38G &gt; A (rs112445441, p.G13D) presented more aggressive tumors with highly invasive features. The present study contributes findings regarding the clinical effects of KRAS alterations in PBT. Based on our study, further investigations are required.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Minnan</author><author>Xiao, Xiuli</author><author>Xing, Xiaorui</author><author>Li, Xin</author><author>Xia, Tian</author><author>Long, Hanan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KRAS and VEGF gene 3'-UTR single nucleotide polymorphisms predicted susceptibility in colorectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0174140</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>28328959</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0174140</electronic-resource-num><notes>We found that the rs3025039C variant genotype in the VEGF gene was associated with a significant protection for CRC (AOR = 0.693, 95% CI = 0.485–0.989; P= 0.043 for CC and CT+TT).

Recent studies have shown that 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) polymorphisms are associated with the occurrence and prognosis of cancers. The aim of this study is to analyze the association between KRAS and VEGF gene 3'-UTR SNPs and genetic susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC). In this case-control study of 371 CRC cases and 246 healthy controls, we analyzed the association between one SNP (rs1137188G &gt; A) in the KRAS gene and four SNPs (rs3025039C &gt; T, rs3025040C &gt; T, rs3025053G &gt; A and rs10434A &gt; G) in the VEGF gene and CRC susceptibility by the improved multiplex ligase detection reaction (iMLDR) method. We checked the selected SNPs' minor allele frequency and its distribution in the frequency of Chinese people by Hap-map database and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and used multivariate logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We found that the rs3025039C variant genotype in the VEGF gene was associated with a significant protection for CRC (AOR = 0.693, 95% CI = 0.485-0.989; P = 0.043 for CC and CT+TT). Nevertheless, the difference was no longer significant after Bonferroni correction (Bonferroni-adjusted P = 0.172). In genetic polymorphisms analysis, we found that the KRAS rs1137188 variant AA genotype had higher portion of tumor size (≥ 5 cm) (P = 0.01; Bonferroni-adjusted P = 0.04), which suggested that the rs1137188 variant AA genotype may significantly be associated with increased progression of CRC. In conclusion, our study suggested that these five SNPs in the KRAS gene and the VEGF gene were not associated with CRC susceptibility in Han Chinese in Sichuan province.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Castellano, Esther</author><author>Santos, Eugenio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional specificity of ras isoforms: so similar but so different.</title><secondary-title>Genes &amp; cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes &amp; cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>216-31</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Ras</keyword><keyword>Ras isoforms</keyword><keyword>canonical Ras</keyword><keyword>functional specificity</keyword><keyword>redundancy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1947601911</isbn><accession-num>21779495</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1947601911408081</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Castellano, Santos - Genes &amp; cancer - Functional specificity of ras isoforms so similar but so different.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://ganc.sagepub.com</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21779495</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3128637</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>H-ras, N-ras, and K-ras are canonical ras gene family members frequently activated by point mutation in human cancers and coding for 4 different, highly related protein isoforms (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B). Their expression is nearly ubiquitous and broadly conserved across eukaryotic species, although there are quantitative and qualitative differences of expression depending on the tissue and/or developmental stage under consideration. Extensive functional studies have determined during the last quarter century that these Ras gene products are critical components of signaling pathways that control eukaryotic cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. However, because of their homology and frequent coexpression in various cellular contexts, it remained unclear whether the different Ras proteins play specific or overlapping functional roles in physiological and pathological processes. Initially, their high degree of sequence homology and the observation that all Ras isoforms share common sets of downstream effectors and upstream activators suggested that they were mostly redundant functionally. In contrast, the notion of functional specificity for each of the different Ras isoforms is supported at present by an increasing body of experimental observations, including 1) the fact that different ras isoforms are preferentially mutated in specific types of tumors or developmental disorders; 2) the different transforming potential of transfected ras genes in different cell contexts; 3) the distinct sensitivities exhibited by the various Ras family members for modulation by different GAPs or GEFs; 4) the demonstration that different Ras isoforms follow distinct intracellular processing pathways and localize to different membrane microdomains or subcellular compartments; 5) the different phenotypes displayed by genetically modified animal strains for each of the 3 ras loci; and 6) the specific transcriptional networks controlled by each isoform in different cellular settings.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, Ryan A.</author><author>Ehrhart, Friederike</author><author>Eijssen, Lars M.

However, fundamental aspects relating to which human proteins exist, where they are expressed and in which quantities are not fully understood. Therefore, we generated a quantitative proteome and transcriptome abundance atlas of 29 paired healthy human tissues from the Human Protein Atlas project representing human genes by 18,072 transcripts and 13,640 proteins including 37 without prior protein-level evidence. The analysis revealed that hundreds of proteins, particularly in testis, could not be detected even for highly expressed mRNAs, that few proteins show tissue-specific expression, that strong differences between mRNA and protein quantities within and across tissues exist and that protein expression is often more stable across tissues than that of transcripts. Only 238 of 9,848 amino acid variants found by exome sequencing could be confidently detected at the protein level showing that proteogenomics remains challenging, needs better computational methods and requires rigorous validation. Many uses of this resource can be envisaged including the study of gene/protein expression regulation and biomarker specificity evaluation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kovalski, Joanna R</author><author>Bhaduri, Aparna</author><author>Zehnder, Ashley M</author><author>Neela, Poornima H</author><author>Che, Yonglu</author><author>Wozniak, Glenn G</author><author>Khavari, Paul A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Functional Proximal Proteome of Oncogenic Ras Includes mTORC2.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cell</full-title></periodical><pages>830-844.e12</pages><volume>73</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>BioID</keyword><keyword>CRISPR</keyword><keyword>MAPKAP1</keyword><keyword>Ras</keyword><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>mTOR</keyword><keyword>proteomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30639242</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molcel.2018.12.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>BioID + CRISPR screen to idnetify new and important RAS interactors

Therefore, BioID was used with wild-type (WT) and oncogenic mutant (MT) H-, K-, and N-Ras, identifying known interactors, including Raf and PI3K, as well as a common set of 130 novel proteins proximal to all Ras isoforms. A CRISPR screen of these proteins for Ras dependence identified mTOR, which was also found proximal to MT Ras in human tumors. Oncogenic Ras directly bound two mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) components, mTOR and MAPKAP1, to promote mTORC2 kinase activity at the plasma membrane. mTORC2 enabled the Ras pro-proliferative cell cycle transcriptional program, and perturbing the Ras-mTORC2 interaction impaired Ras-dependent neoplasia in vivo. Combining proximity-dependent proteomics with CRISPR screening identified a new set of functional Ras-associated proteins, defined mTORC2 as a new direct Ras effector, and offers a strategy for finding new proteins that cooperate with dominant oncogenes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Havel, Jonathan J</author><author>Chowell, Diego</author><author>Chan, Timothy A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The evolving landscape of biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

Yet, only a subset of patients derive clinical benefit. It is thus critical to understand the determinants driving response, resistance and adverse effects. In this Review, we discuss recent work demonstrating that immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy is affected by a combination of factors involving tumour genomics, host germline genetics, PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1) levels and other features of the tumour microenvironment, as well as the gut microbiome. We focus on recently identified molecular and cellular determinants of response. A better understanding of how these variables cooperate to affect tumour-host interactions is needed to optimize the implementation of precision immunotherapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Edenberg, Ellen R.</author><author>Downey, Michael</author><author>Toczyski, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polymerase stalling during replication, transcription and translation.</title><secondary-title>Current biology : CB</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current biology : CB</full-title></periodical><pages>R445-52</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24845677</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.060</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Edenberg, Downey, Toczyski - Current biology CB - Polymerase stalling during replication, transcription and translation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.060</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982214003522</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845677</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Replication, transcription, and translation stress all lead to stalling of their respective polymerases (DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, and the ribosome), and the cell must respond to these events in order to preserve macromolecular integrity. In response to replication stress such as DNA damage, the cell activates a checkpoint and promotes repair or bypass at the lesion. Transcriptional stress leading to stalling of RNA polymerase can also be caused by DNA damage, and recognizing stalled RNA polymerase can lead to transcription-coupled repair or, in response to prolonged stalling, degradation of the polymerase. Translational stress generated by problems either with the mRNA template or the ribosome itself also leads to stalling of the ribosome, and the cell responds by degrading both the message and the nascent polypeptide. In this review, we will discuss the stresses that lead to stalling of each of the polymerases and how the cell recognizes and responds to the stalled enzymes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Magistris, Paola</author><author>Antonin, Wolfram</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Dynamic Nature of the Nuclear Envelope.</title><secondary-title>Current biology : CB</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current biology : CB</full-title></periodical><pages>R487-R497</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29689232</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cub.2018.01.073</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - De Magistris, Antonin - Current biology CB - The Dynamic Nature of the Nuclear Envelope.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.01.073</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982218301064</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29689232</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Eukaryotes characteristically organize their genome in a separate compartment, the nucleus, which is surrounded by the nuclear envelope as a barrier. Ruptures of the nuclear envelope and exposure of chromatin threaten cell viability and cause genome instability. Despite its essential boundary function, the nuclear envelope undergoes remarkable morphological changes, most noticeable during mitosis. Here we summarize our current understanding of nuclear envelope dynamics and its mutable relationship to the endoplasmic reticulum. We discuss how the nuclear envelope is remodeled to insert nuclear pore complexes, the transport gates of the nucleus, into its double membrane structure. Recent 3D electron microscopy time courses of assembling nuclear pore complexes show that these structures integrate into the nuclear envelope during interphase and mitosis following different pathways. Both pathways ensure that pores are formed in the nuclear envelope connecting cytoplasm and nucleoplasm.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tao, Yong</author><author>Kang, Byunghak</author><author>Petkovich, Daniel A</author><author>Bhandari, Yuba R</author><author>In, Julie</author><author>Stein-O'Brien, Genevieve</author><author>Kong, Xiangqian</author><author>Xie, Wenbing</author><author>Zachos, Nicholas</author><author>Maegawa, Shinji</author><author>Vaidya, Himani</author><author>Brown, Stephen</author><author>Chiu Yen, Ray-Whay</author><author>Shao, Xiaojian</author><author>Thakor, Jai</author><author>Lu, Zhihao</author><author>Cai, Yi</author><author>Zhang, Yuezheng</author><author>Mallona, Izaskun</author><author>Peinado, Miguel Angel</author><author>Zahnow, Cynthia A</author><author>Ahuja, Nita</author><author>Fertig, Elana</author><author>Issa, Jean-Pierre</author><author>Baylin, Stephen B</author><author>Easwaran, Hariharan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aging-like Spontaneous Epigenetic Silencing Facilitates Wnt Activation, Stemness, and BrafV600E-Induced Tumorigenesis.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>315-328.e6</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>BRAF(V600E)</keyword><keyword>CIMP</keyword><keyword>CpG-island DNA methylation</keyword><keyword>aging</keyword><keyword>cancer risk</keyword><keyword>colon adenocarcinomas</keyword><keyword>epigenetic silencing</keyword><keyword>transformation</keyword><keyword>tumor predisposition</keyword><keyword>tumorigenesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30753828</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2019.01.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Tao et al. - Cancer cell - Aging-like Spontaneous Epigenetic Silencing Facilitates Wnt Activation, Stemness, and BrafV600E-Induce.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2019.01.005</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753828</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We addressed the precursor role of aging-like spontaneous promoter DNA hypermethylation in initiating tumorigenesis. Using mouse colon-derived organoids, we show that promoter hypermethylation spontaneously arises in cells mimicking the human aging-like phenotype. The silenced genes activate the Wnt pathway, causing a stem-like state and differentiation defects. These changes render aged organoids profoundly more sensitive than young ones to transformation by BrafV600E, producing the typical human proximal BRAFV600E-driven colon adenocarcinomas characterized by extensive, abnormal gene-promoter CpG-island methylation, or the methylator phenotype (CIMP). Conversely, CRISPR-mediated simultaneous inactivation of a panel of the silenced genes markedly sensitizes to BrafV600E-induced transformation. Our studies tightly link aging-like epigenetic abnormalities to intestinal cell fate changes and predisposition to oncogene-driven colon tumorigenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grolleman, Judith E</author><author>de Voer, Richarda M.</author><author>Elsayed, Fadwa A</author><author>Nielsen, Maartje</author><author>Weren, Robbert D A</author><author>Palles, Claire</author><author>Ligtenberg, Marjolijn J L</author><author>Vos, Janet R.</author><author>Ten Broeke, Sanne W</author><author>de Miranda, Noel F C C</author><author>Kuiper, Renske A</author><author>Kamping, Eveline J.</author><author>Jansen, Erik A M</author><author>Vink-Börger, M.

We describe 29 individuals carrying biallelic germline NTHL1 mutations from 17 families, of which 26 developed one (n = 10) or multiple (n = 16) malignancies in 14 different tissues. An unexpected high breast cancer incidence was observed in female carriers (60%). Mutational signature analysis of 14 tumors from 7 organs revealed that NTHL1 deficiency underlies the main mutational process in all but one of the tumors (93%). These results reveal NTHL1 as a multi-tumor predisposition gene with a high lifetime risk for extracolonic cancers and a typical mutational signature observed across tumor types, which can assist in the recognition of this syndrome.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yin, Chengqian</author><author>Zhu, Bo</author><author>Zhang, Ting</author><author>Liu, Tongzheng</author><author>Chen, Shuyang</author><author>Liu, Yu</author><author>Li, Xin</author><author>Miao, Xiao</author><author>Li, Shanshan</author><author>Mi, Xia</author><author>Zhang, Jie</author><author>Li, Li</author><author>Wei, Guo</author><author>Xu, Zhi-xiang</author><author>Gao, Xiumei</author><author>Huang, Canhua</author><author>Wei, Zhi</author><author>Goding, Colin R.</author><author>Wang, Peng</author><author>Deng, Xianming</author><author>Cui, Rutao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pharmacological Targeting of STK19 Inhibits Oncogenic NRAS-Driven Melanomagenesis.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>1113-1127.e16</pages><volume>176</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>NRAS</keyword><keyword>RAS</keyword><keyword>STK19</keyword><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>drug screening</keyword><keyword>kinase inhibitor</keyword><keyword>melanoma</keyword><keyword>melanomagenesis</keyword><keyword>targeted cancer therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30712867</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Do we find comutation with SKCM Q61R and STK19

Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized serine/threonine kinase STK19 as a novel NRAS activator. STK19 phosphorylates NRAS to enhance its binding to its downstream effectors and promotes oncogenic NRAS-mediated melanocyte malignant transformation. A recurrent D89N substitution in STK19 whose alterations were identified in 25% of human melanomas represents a gain-of-function mutation that interacts better with NRAS to enhance melanocyte transformation. STK19D89N knockin leads to skin hyperpigmentation and promotes NRASQ61R-driven melanomagenesis in vivo. Finally, we developed ZT-12-037-01 (1a) as a specific STK19-targeted inhibitor and showed that it effectively blocks oncogenic NRAS-driven melanocyte malignant transformation and melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings provide a new and viable therapeutic strategy for melanomas harboring NRAS mutations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Neurohr, Gabriel E</author><author>Terry, Rachel L</author><author>Lengefeld, Jette</author><author>Bonney, Megan</author><author>Brittingham, Gregory P.</author><author>Moretto, Fabien</author><author>Miettinen, Teemu P.</author><author>Vaites, Laura Pontano</author><author>Soares, Luis M.</author><author>Paulo, Joao A.</author><author>Harper, J.

Why maintenance of a cell-type specific cell size is important remains poorly understood. Here we show that growing budding yeast and primary mammalian cells beyond a certain size impairs gene induction, cell-cycle progression, and cell signaling. These defects are due to the inability of large cells to scale nucleic acid and protein biosynthesis in accordance with cell volume increase, which effectively leads to cytoplasm dilution. We further show that loss of scaling beyond a certain critical size is due to DNA becoming limiting. Based on the observation that senescent cells are large and exhibit many of the phenotypes of large cells, we propose that the range of DNA:cytoplasm ratio that supports optimal cell function is limited and that ratios outside these bounds contribute to aging.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tucci, Valter</author><author>Isles, Anthony R</author><author>Kelsey, Gavin</author><author>Ferguson-Smith, Anne C</author><author>Erice Imprinting Group</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic Imprinting and Physiological Processes in Mammals.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>952-965</pages><volume>176</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30794780</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.043</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Tucci et al. - Cell - Genomic Imprinting and Physiological Processes in Mammals.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.043</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867419301060</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30794780</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Complex multicellular organisms, such as mammals, express two complete sets of chromosomes per nucleus, combining the genetic material of both parents. However, epigenetic studies have demonstrated violations to this rule that are necessary for mammalian physiology; the most notable parental allele expression phenomenon is genomic imprinting. With the identification of endogenous imprinted genes, genomic imprinting became well-established as an epigenetic mechanism in which the expression pattern of a parental allele influences phenotypic expression. The expanding study of genomic imprinting is revealing a significant impact on brain functions and associated diseases. Here, we review key milestones in the field of imprinting and discuss mechanisms and systems in which imprinted genes exert a significant role.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Lingfei</author><author>Wang, Dashun</author><author>Evans, James A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Large teams develop and small teams disrupt science and technology.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30760923</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41586-019-0941-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Wu, Wang, Evans - Nature - Large teams develop and small teams disrupt science and technology.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760923</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>One of the most universal trends in science and technology today is the growth of large teams in all areas, as solitary researchers and small teams diminish in prevalence1-3. Increases in team size have been attributed to the specialization of scientific activities3, improvements in communication technology4,5, or the complexity of modern problems that require interdisciplinary solutions6-8. This shift in team size raises the question of whether and how the character of the science and technology produced by large teams differs from that of small teams. Here we analyse more than 65 million papers, patents and software products that span the period 1954-2014, and demonstrate that across this period smaller teams have tended to disrupt science and technology with new ideas and opportunities, whereas larger teams have tended to develop existing ones. Work from larger teams builds on more-recent and popular developments, and attention to their work comes immediately. By contrast, contributions by smaller teams search more deeply into the past, are viewed as disruptive to science and technology and succeed further into the future-if at all. Observed differences between small and large teams are magnified for higher-impact work, with small teams known for disruptive work and large teams for developing work. Differences in topic and research design account for a small part of the relationship between team size and disruption; most of the effect occurs at the level of the individual, as people move between smaller and larger teams. These results demonstrate that both small and large teams are essential to a flourishing ecology of science and technology, and suggest that, to achieve this, science policies should aim to support a diversity of team sizes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, Ling-Hao</author><author>Huang, Qin-Wei</author><author>Zhou, Xiong-Hui</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of Cancer Hallmarks Based on the Gene Co-expression Networks of Seven Cancers</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>February</issue><keywords><keyword>cancer hallmarks</keyword><keyword>cancer hallmarks, gene co-expression network, canc</keyword><keyword>cancer prognosis</keyword><keyword>drug target</keyword><keyword>gene co-expression network</keyword><keyword>pan-cancer analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fgene.2019.00099</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Yu, Huang, Zhou - Frontiers in Genetics - Identification of Cancer Hallmarks Based on the Gene Co-expression Networks of Seven Ca.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2019.00099/full</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Han</author><author>Li, Chunyan</author><author>Peng, Xinxin</author><author>Zhou, Zhicheng</author><author>Weinstein, John N.</author><author>Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network</author><author>Liang, Han</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Pan-Cancer Analysis of Enhancer Expression in Nearly 9000 Patient Samples.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>386-399.e12</pages><volume>173</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>PD-L1 expression</keyword><keyword>The Cancer Genome Atlas</keyword><keyword>aneuploidy</keyword><keyword>chromatin state</keyword><keyword>enhancer expression</keyword><keyword>mutation burden</keyword><keyword>pan-cancer analysis</keyword><keyword>prognostic markers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>00928674</isbn><accession-num>29625054</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.027</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Chen et al. - Cell - A Pan-Cancer Analysis of Enhancer Expression in Nearly 9000 Patient Samples.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29625054</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5890960</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The role of enhancers, a key class of non-coding regulatory DNA elements, in cancer development has increasingly been appreciated. Here, we present the detection and characterization of a large number of expressed enhancers in a genome-wide analysis of 8928 tumor samples across 33 cancer types using TCGA RNA-seq data. Compared with matched normal tissues, global enhancer activation was observed in most cancers. Across cancer types, global enhancer activity was positively associated with aneuploidy, but not mutation load, suggesting a hypothesis centered on &quot;chromatin-state&quot; to explain their interplay. Integrating eQTL, mRNA co-expression, and Hi-C data analysis, we developed a computational method to infer causal enhancer-gene interactions, revealing enhancers of clinically actionable genes. Having identified an enhancer ∼140 kb downstream of PD-L1, a major immunotherapy target, we validated it experimentally. This study provides a systematic view of enhancer activity in diverse tumor contexts and suggests the clinical implications of enhancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Edward Y</author><author>Tan, Christopher M</author><author>Kou, Yan</author><author>Duan, Qiaonan</author><author>Wang, Zichen</author><author>Meirelles, Gabriela Vaz</author><author>Clark, Neil R</author><author>Ma'ayan, Avi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enrichr: interactive and collaborative HTML5 gene list enrichment analysis tool.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>128</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0001-6268</isbn><accession-num>23586463</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-14-128</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Chen et al. - BMC bioinformatics - Enrichr interactive and collaborative HTML5 gene list enrichment analysis tool.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577452</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23586463</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3637064</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND System-wide profiling of genes and proteins in mammalian cells produce lists of differentially expressed genes/proteins that need to be further analyzed for their collective functions in order to extract new knowledge. Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments, these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed, there is still room for improvement. RESULTS Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new gene-set libraries, an alternative approach to rank enriched terms, and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library, Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells.

However, the molecular events underlying these GNAQ-driven malignancies are not yet defined, thus limiting the ability to develop cancer-targeted therapies. Here, we focused on the transcriptional coactivator YAP, a critical component of the Hippo signaling pathway that controls organ size. We found that Gαq stimulates YAP through a Trio-Rho/Rac signaling circuitry promoting actin polymerization, independently of phospholipase Cβ and the canonical Hippo pathway. Furthermore, we show that Gαq promotes the YAP-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells, thereby identifying YAP as a suitable therapeutic target in uveal melanoma, a GNAQ/GNA11-initiated human malignancy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bhandari, Vinayak</author><author>Hoey, Christianne</author><author>Liu, Lydia Y</author><author>Lalonde, Emilie</author><author>Ray, Jessica</author><author>Livingstone, Julie</author><author>Lesurf, Robert</author><author>Shiah, Yu-Jia</author><author>Vujcic, Tina</author><author>Huang, Xiaoyong</author><author>Espiritu, Shadrielle M.

Hypoxic tumors are at elevated risk for local failure and distant metastasis, but the molecular hallmarks of tumor hypoxia remain poorly defined. To fill this gap, we quantified hypoxia in 8,006 tumors across 19 tumor types. In ten tumor types, hypoxia was associated with elevated genomic instability. In all 19 tumor types, hypoxic tumors exhibited characteristic driver-mutation signatures. We observed widespread hypoxia-associated dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) across cancers and functionally validated miR-133a-3p as a hypoxia-modulated miRNA. In localized prostate cancer, hypoxia was associated with elevated rates of chromothripsis, allelic loss of PTEN and shorter telomeres. These associations are particularly enriched in polyclonal tumors, representing a constellation of features resembling tumor nimbosus, an aggressive cellular phenotype. Overall, this work establishes that tumor hypoxia may drive aggressive molecular features across cancers and shape the clinical trajectory of individual tumors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Samstein, Robert M.</author><author>Lee, Chung-Han</author><author>Shoushtari, Alexander N.</author><author>Hellmann, Matthew D.</author><author>Shen, Ronglai</author><author>Janjigian, Yelena Y.</author><author>Barron, David A.</author><author>Zehir, Ahmet</author><author>Jordan, Emmet J.</author><author>Omuro, Antonio</author><author>Kaley, Thomas J.</author><author>Kendall, Sviatoslav M.</author><author>Motzer, Robert J.</author><author>Hakimi, A.

Findings in selected cancer types suggest that tumor mutational burden (TMB) may predict clinical response to ICI. To examine this association more broadly, we analyzed the clinical and genomic data of 1,662 advanced cancer patients treated with ICI, and 5,371 non-ICI-treated patients, whose tumors underwent targeted next-generation sequencing (MSK-IMPACT). Among all patients, higher somatic TMB (highest 20% in each histology) was associated with better overall survival. For most cancer histologies, an association between higher TMB and improved survival was observed. The TMB cutpoints associated with improved survival varied markedly between cancer types. These data indicate that TMB is associated with improved survival in patients receiving ICI across a wide variety of cancer types, but that there may not be one universal definition of high TMB.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vo, Josh N.</author><author>Cieslik, Marcin</author><author>Zhang, Yajia</author><author>Shukla, Sudhanshu</author><author>Xiao, Lanbo</author><author>Zhang, Yuping</author><author>Wu, Yi-Mi</author><author>Dhanasekaran, Saravana M.</author><author>Engelke, Carl G.</author><author>Cao, Xuhong</author><author>Robinson, Dan R.</author><author>Nesvizhskii, Alexey I.</author><author>Chinnaiyan, Arul M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Landscape of Circular RNA in Cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>869-881.e13</pages><volume>176</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>biomarkers</keyword><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>circRNA</keyword><keyword>circRNA database</keyword><keyword>exome capture sequencing</keyword><keyword>non-coding RNA</keyword><keyword>read-through transcripts</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30735636</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.021</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Vo et al. - Cell - The Landscape of Circular RNA in Cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.021</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735636</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an intriguing class of RNA due to their covalently closed structure, high stability, and implicated roles in gene regulation. Here, we used an exome capture RNA sequencing protocol to detect and characterize circRNAs across &gt;2,000 cancer samples. When compared against Ribo-Zero and RNase R, capture sequencing significantly enhanced the enrichment of circRNAs and preserved accurate circular-to-linear ratios. Using capture sequencing, we built the most comprehensive catalog of circRNA species to date: MiOncoCirc, the first database to be composed primarily of circRNAs directly detected in tumor tissues. Using MiOncoCirc, we identified candidate circRNAs to serve as biomarkers for prostate cancer and were able to detect circRNAs in urine. We further detected a novel class of circular transcripts, termed read-through circRNAs, that involved exons originating from different genes. MiOncoCirc will serve as a valuable resource for the development of circRNAs as diagnostic or therapeutic targets across cancer types.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Connor, Ashton A</author><author>Denroche, Robert E</author><author>Jang, Gun Ho</author><author>Lemire, Mathieu</author><author>Zhang, Amy</author><author>Chan-Seng-Yue, Michelle</author><author>Wilson, Gavin</author><author>Grant, Robert C</author><author>Merico, Daniele</author><author>Lungu, Ilinca</author><author>Bartlett, John M S</author><author>Chadwick, Dianne</author><author>Liang, Sheng-Ben</author><author>Eagles, Jenna</author><author>Mbabaali, Faridah</author><author>Miller, Jessica K</author><author>Krzyzanowski, Paul</author><author>Armstrong, Heather</author><author>Luo, Xuemei</author><author>Jorgensen, Lars G T</author><author>Romero, Joan M</author><author>Bavi, Prashant</author><author>Fischer, Sandra E</author><author>Serra, Stefano</author><author>Hafezi-Bakhtiari, Sara</author><author>Caglar, Derin</author><author>Roehrl, Michael H A</author><author>Cleary, Sean</author><author>Hollingsworth, Michael A</author><author>Petersen, Gloria M</author><author>Thayer, Sarah</author><author>Law, Calvin H L</author><author>Nanji, Sulaiman</author><author>Golan, Talia</author><author>Smith, Alyssa L</author><author>Borgida, Ayelet</author><author>Dodd, Anna</author><author>Hedley, David</author><author>Wouters, Bradly G</author><author>O'Kane, Grainne M</author><author>Wilson, Julie M</author><author>Zogopoulos, George</author><author>Notta, Faiyaz</author><author>Knox, Jennifer J</author><author>Gallinger, Steven</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integration of Genomic and Transcriptional Features in Pancreatic Cancer Reveals Increased Cell Cycle Progression in Metastases.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>267-282.e7</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>RNA sequencing</keyword><keyword>cell cycle progression</keyword><keyword>driver genes</keyword><keyword>hypoxia</keyword><keyword>metastases</keyword><keyword>mutational signatures</keyword><keyword>pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</keyword><keyword>whole-genome sequencing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><accession-num>30686769</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2018.12.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Connor et al. - Cancer cell - Integration of Genomic and Transcriptional Features in Pancreatic Cancer Reveals Increased Cell Cyc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686769</url><url>https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(18)30582-8</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>We integrated clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic data from 224 primaries and 95 metastases from 289 patients to characterize progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

Therapeutic inhibition of C5aR1 via the peptide antagonist PMX-53 improved efficacy of paclitaxel chemotherapy associated with increased presence and cytotoxic properties of CXCR3+ effector memory CD8+ T cells in carcinomas, dependent on both macrophage transcriptional programming and IFNγ.

However, there are no effective therapies for UM. Using an integrated bioinformatics pipeline, we found that PTK2, encoding focal adhesion kinase (FAK), represents a candidate synthetic lethal gene with GNAQ activation. We show that Gαq activates FAK through TRIO-RhoA non-canonical Gαq-signaling, and genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of FAK inhibits UM growth. Analysis of the FAK-regulated transcriptome demonstrated that GNAQ stimulates YAP through FAK. Dissection of the underlying mechanism revealed that FAK regulates YAP by tyrosine phosphorylation of MOB1, inhibiting core Hippo signaling. Our findings establish FAK as a potential therapeutic target for UM and other Gαq-driven pathophysiologies that involve unrestrained YAP function.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scala, Giovanni</author><author>Serra, Angela</author><author>Marwah, Veer Singh</author><author>Saarimäki, Laura Aliisa</author><author>Greco, Dario</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FunMappOne: a tool to hierarchically organize and visually navigate functional gene annotations in multiple experiments.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>79</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Functional annotation</keyword><keyword>Gene Ontology</keyword><keyword>KEGG</keyword><keyword>Ontology visualization</keyword><keyword>Pathway visualization</keyword><keyword>R-Shiny</keyword><keyword>Reactome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30767762</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-019-2639-2</electronic-resource-num><notes>1-4 for other methods of anno

Multiple databases and methods are currently available to summarize the functions of sets of genes into higher level representations, such as ontologies and molecular pathways. Annotating results from omics experiments into functional categories is essential not only to understand the underlying regulatory dynamics but also to compare multiple experimental conditions at a higher level of abstraction. Several tools are already available to the community to represent and compare functional profiles of omics experiments. However, when the number of experiments and/or enriched functional terms is high, it becomes difficult to interpret the results even when graphically represented. Therefore, there is currently a need for interactive and user-friendly tools to graphically navigate and further summarize annotations in order to facilitate results interpretation also when the dimensionality is high. RESULTS We developed an approach that exploits the intrinsic hierarchical structure of several functional annotations to summarize the results obtained through enrichment analyses to higher levels of interpretation and to map gene related information at each summarized level. We built a user-friendly graphical interface that allows to visualize the functional annotations of one or multiple experiments at once. The tool is implemented as a R-Shiny application called FunMappOne and is available at https://github.com/grecolab/FunMappOne . CONCLUSION FunMappOne is a R-shiny graphical tool that takes in input multiple lists of human or mouse genes, optionally along with their related modification magnitudes, computes the enriched annotations from Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, or Reactome databases, and reports interactive maps of functional terms and pathways organized in rational groups. FunMappOne allows a fast and convenient comparison of multiple experiments and an easy way to interpret results.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alli-Shaik, Asfa</author><author>Wee, Sheena</author><author>Lim, Lina H K</author><author>Gunaratne, Jayantha</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphoproteomics reveals network rewiring to a pro-adhesion state in annexin-1-deficient mammary epithelial cells.</title><secondary-title>Breast cancer research : BCR</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast cancer research : BCR</full-title></periodical><pages>132</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adhesion</keyword><keyword>Annexin-1</keyword><keyword>Breast cancer</keyword><keyword>Mammary epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>Network analysis</keyword><keyword>Phosphoproteomics</keyword><keyword>Proteomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>1305801709244</isbn><accession-num>29233185</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13058-017-0924-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Alli-Shaik et al. - Breast cancer research BCR - Phosphoproteomics reveals network rewiring to a pro-adhesion state in annexin-1.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13058-017-0924-4</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233185</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5727667</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Annexin-1 (ANXA1) plays pivotal roles in regulating various physiological processes including inflammation, proliferation and apoptosis, and deregulation of ANXA1 functions has been associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis events in several types of cancer. Though ANXA1 levels correlate with breast cancer disease status and outcome, its distinct functional involvement in breast cancer initiation and progression remains unclear. We hypothesized that ANXA1-responsive kinase signaling alteration and associated phosphorylation signaling underlie early events in breast cancer initiation events and hence profiled ANXA1-dependent phosphorylation changes in mammary gland epithelial cells. METHODS Quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis of mammary gland epithelial cells derived from ANXA1-heterozygous and ANXA1-deficient mice was carried out using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry. Kinase and signaling changes underlying ANXA1 perturbations were derived by upstream kinase prediction and integrated network analysis of altered proteins and phosphoproteins. RESULTS We identified a total of 8110 unique phosphorylation sites, of which 582 phosphorylation sites on 372 proteins had ANXA1-responsive changes. A majority of these phosphorylation changes occurred on proteins associated with cytoskeletal reorganization spanning the focal adhesion, stress fibers, and also the microtubule network proposing new roles for ANXA1 in regulating microtubule dynamics. Comparative analysis of regulated global proteome and phosphoproteome highlighted key differences in translational and post-translational effects of ANXA1, and suggested closely coordinated rewiring of the cell adhesion network. Kinase prediction analysis suggested activity modulation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2), P21-activated kinase (PAK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and IκB kinase (IKK) upon loss of ANXA1. Integrative analysis revealed regulation of the WNT and Hippo signaling pathways in ANXA1-deficient mammary epithelial cells, wherein there is downregulation of transcriptional effects of TEA domain family (TEAD) suggestive of ANXA1-responsive transcriptional rewiring. CONCLUSIONS The phosphoproteome landscape uncovered several novel perspectives for ANXA1 in mammary gland biology and highlighted its involvement in key signaling pathways modulating cell adhesion and migration that could contribute to breast cancer initiation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cifani, Paolo</author><author>Shakiba, Mojdeh</author><author>Chhangawala, Sagar</author><author>Kentsis, Alex</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ProteoModlR for functional proteomic analysis.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>153</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Functional analysis</keyword><keyword>Mass spectrometry</keyword><keyword>Post-translational modification stoichiometry</keyword><keyword>Quantitative proteomics</keyword><keyword>R</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>14712105 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>28259147</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-017-1563-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Cifani et al. - BMC bioinformatics - ProteoModlR for functional proteomic analysis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://github.com/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28259147</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5336658</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND High-accuracy mass spectrometry enables near comprehensive quantification of the components of the cellular proteomes, increasingly including their chemically modified variants. Likewise, large-scale libraries of quantified synthetic peptides are becoming available, enabling absolute quantification of chemically modified proteoforms, and therefore systems-level analyses of changes of their absolute abundance and stoichiometry. Existing computational methods provide advanced tools for mass spectral analysis and statistical inference, but lack integrated functions for quantitative analysis of post-translationally modified proteins and their modification stoichiometry. RESULTS Here, we develop ProteoModlR, a program for quantitative analysis of abundance and stoichiometry of post-translational chemical modifications across temporal and steady-state biological states. While ProteoModlR is intended for the analysis of experiments using isotopically labeled reference peptides for absolute quantitation, it also supports the analysis of labeled and label-free data, acquired in both data-dependent and data-independent modes for relative quantitation. Moreover, ProteoModlR enables functional analysis of sparsely sampled quantitative mass spectrometry experiments by inferring the missing values from the available measurements, without imputation. The implemented architecture includes parsing and normalization functions to control for common sources of technical variation. Finally, ProteoModlR's modular design and interchangeable format are optimally suited for integration with existing computational proteomics tools, thereby facilitating comprehensive quantitative analysis of cellular signaling. CONCLUSIONS ProteoModlR and its documentation are available for download at http://github.com/kentsisresearchgroup/ProteoModlR as a stand-alone R package.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klammer, Martin</author><author>Godl, Klaus</author><author>Tebbe, Andreas</author><author>Schaab, Christoph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying differentially regulated subnetworks from phosphoproteomic data.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>351</pages><volume>11</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1471210511379</isbn><accession-num>20584295</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-11-351</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited other methods: 11, 12</notes><research-notes>cited other methods: 11, 12</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Klammer et al. - BMC bioinformatics - Identifying differentially regulated subnetworks from phosphoproteomic data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/351</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20584295</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2914729</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:tissuespec</label><abstract>BACKGROUND Various high throughput methods are available for detecting regulations at the level of transcription, translation or posttranslation (e.g. phosphorylation). Integrating these data with protein networks should make it possible to identify subnetworks that are significantly regulated. Furthermore, such integration can support identification of regulated entities from often noisy high throughput data. In particular, processing mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic data in this manner may expose signal transduction pathways and, in the case of experiments with drug-treated cells, reveal the drug's mode of action. RESULTS Here, we introduce SubExtractor, an algorithm that combines phosphoproteomic data with protein network information from STRING to identify differentially regulated subnetworks and individual proteins. The method is based on a Bayesian probabilistic model combined with a genetic algorithm and rigorous significance testing. The Bayesian model accounts for information about both differential regulation and network topology. The method was tested with artificial data and subsequently applied to a comprehensive phosphoproteomics study investigating the mode of action of sorafenib, a small molecule kinase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS SubExtractor reliably identifies differentially regulated subnetworks from phosphoproteomic data by integrating protein networks. The method can also be applied to gene or protein expression data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lachmann, Alexander</author><author>Ma'ayan, Avi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lists2Networks: integrated analysis of gene/protein lists.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>87</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20152038</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-11-87</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Lachmann, Ma'ayan - BMC bioinformatics - Lists2Networks integrated analysis of geneprotein lists.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.lists2networks.org.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20152038</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2843617</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Systems biologists are faced with the difficulty of analyzing results from large-scale studies that profile the activity of many genes, RNAs and proteins, applied in different experiments, under different conditions, and reported in different publications. To address this challenge it is desirable to compare the results from different related studies such as mRNA expression microarrays, genome-wide ChIP-X, RNAi screens, proteomics and phosphoproteomics experiments in a coherent global framework. In addition, linking high-content multilayered experimental results with prior biological knowledge can be useful for identifying functional themes and form novel hypotheses. RESULTS We present Lists2Networks, a web-based system that allows users to upload lists of mammalian genes/proteins onto a server-based program for integrated analysis. The system includes web-based tools to manipulate lists with different set operations, to expand lists using existing mammalian networks of protein-protein interactions, co-expression correlation, or background knowledge co-annotation correlation, as well as to apply gene-list enrichment analyses against many gene-list libraries of prior biological knowledge such as pathways, gene ontology terms, kinase-substrate, microRNA-mRAN, and protein-protein interactions, metabolites, and protein domains. Such analyses can be applied to several lists at once against many prior knowledge libraries of gene-lists associated with specific annotations. The system also contains features that allow users to export networks and share lists with other users of the system. CONCLUSIONS Lists2Networks is a user friendly web-based software system expected to significantly ease the computational analysis process for experimental systems biologists employing high-throughput experiments at multiple layers of regulation.

These interactions are usually represented as large and complex networks, calling for the development of appropriated tools to exploit the functional information they contain. Random walk with restart (RWR) is the state-of-the-art guilt-by-association approach. It explores the network vicinity of gene/protein seeds to study their functions, based on the premise that nodes related to similar functions tend to lie close to each other in the networks. Results In this study, we extended the RWR algorithm to multiplex and heterogeneous networks. The walk can now explore different layers of physical and functional interactions between genes and proteins, such as protein-protein interactions and co-expression associations. In addition, the walk can also jump to a network containing different sets of edges and nodes, such as phenotype similarities between diseases. We devised a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to evaluate the algorithms abilities to predict disease-associated genes. We demonstrate the increased performances of the multiplex-heterogeneous RWR as compared to several random walks on monoplex or heterogeneous networks. Overall, our framework is able to leverage the different interaction sources to outperform current approaches. Finally, we applied the algorithm to predict candidate genes for the Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome, and to explore the network vicinity of the SHORT syndrome.

Unraveling the nature of this intricate network, composed of kinases, target proteins and their interactions, is therefore of crucial importance. Although thousands of kinase-specific phosphorylations (KsP) have been annotated in model organisms their kinase-target network is far from being complete, with less studied organisms lagging behind. Results In this work, we achieved an automated and accurate identification of kinase domains, inferring the residues that most likely contribute to peptide specificity. We integrated this information with the target peptides of known human KsP to predict kinase-specific interactions in other eukaryotes through a deep neural network, outperforming similar methods. We analyzed the differential conservation of kinase specificity among eukaryotes revealing the high conservation of the specificity of tyrosine kinases. With this approach we discovered 1590 novel KsP of potential clinical relevance in the human proteome. Availability and implementation http://akid.bio.uniroma2.it.

We analyzed somatic mutations and DNA methylation in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic mutation load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related cancer types.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Jianjun</author><author>Fujimoto, Junya</author><author>Zhang, Jianhua</author><author>Wedge, David C</author><author>Song, Xingzhi</author><author>Zhang, Jiexin</author><author>Seth, Sahil</author><author>Chow, Chi-Wan</author><author>Cao, Yu</author><author>Gumbs, Curtis</author><author>Gold, Kathryn A</author><author>Kalhor, Neda</author><author>Little, Latasha</author><author>Mahadeshwar, Harshad</author><author>Moran, Cesar</author><author>Protopopov, Alexei</author><author>Sun, Huandong</author><author>Tang, Jiabin</author><author>Wu, Xifeng</author><author>Ye, Yuanqing</author><author>William, William N</author><author>Lee, J Jack</author><author>Heymach, John V</author><author>Hong, Waun Ki</author><author>Swisher, Stephen</author><author>Wistuba, Ignacio I</author><author>Futreal, P Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intratumor heterogeneity in localized lung adenocarcinomas delineated by multiregion sequencing.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>256-9</pages><volume>346</volume><issue>6206</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>0000100080</isbn><accession-num>25301631</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1256930</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Zhang et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Intratumor heterogeneity in localized lung adenocarcinomas delineated by multiregion se.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25301631</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4354858</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancers are composed of populations of cells with distinct molecular and phenotypic features, a phenomenon termed intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). ITH in lung cancers has not been well studied. We applied multiregion whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 11 localized lung adenocarcinomas. All tumors showed clear evidence of ITH. On average, 76% of all mutations and 20 out of 21 known cancer gene mutations were identified in all regions of individual tumors, which suggested that single-region sequencing may be adequate to identify the majority of known cancer gene mutations in localized lung adenocarcinomas. With a median follow-up of 21 months after surgery, three patients have relapsed, and all three patients had significantly larger fractions of subclonal mutations in their primary tumors than patients without relapse.

This is particularly true for pancreatic cancers, where most patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and few show a sustained response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Whether the dismal prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with other types of cancer is a result of late diagnosis or early dissemination of disease to distant organs is not known. Here we rely on data generated by sequencing the genomes of seven pancreatic cancer metastases to evaluate the clonal relationships among primary and metastatic cancers. We find that clonal populations that give rise to distant metastases are represented within the primary carcinoma, but these clones are genetically evolved from the original parental, non-metastatic clone. Thus, genetic heterogeneity of metastases reflects that within the primary carcinoma. A quantitative analysis of the timing of the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer was performed, indicating at least a decade between the occurrence of the initiating mutation and the birth of the parental, non-metastatic founder cell. At least five more years are required for the acquisition of metastatic ability and patients die an average of two years thereafter. These data provide novel insights into the genetic features underlying pancreatic cancer progression and define a broad time window of opportunity for early detection to prevent deaths from metastatic disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prior, Ian A</author><author>Lewis, Paul D</author><author>Mattos, Carla</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comprehensive survey of Ras mutations in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>2457-67</pages><volume>72</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>4415179444</isbn><accession-num>22589270</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-2612</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Prior, Lewis, Mattos - Cancer research - A comprehensive survey of Ras mutations in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.aacrjournals.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22589270</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3354961</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>All mammalian cells express 3 closely related Ras proteins, termed H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras, that promote oncogenesis when they are mutationally activated at codon 12, 13, or 61. Although there is a high degree of similarity among the isoforms, K-Ras mutations are far more frequently observed in cancer, and each isoform displays preferential coupling to particular cancer types. We examined the mutational spectra of Ras isoforms curated from large-scale tumor profiling and found that each isoform exhibits surprisingly distinctive codon mutation and amino-acid substitution biases. These findings were unexpected given that these mutations occur in regions that share 100% amino-acid sequence identity among the 3 isoforms. Of importance, many of these mutational biases were not due to differences in exposure to mutagens, because the patterns were still evident when compared within specific cancer types. We discuss potential genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, as well as isoform-specific differences in protein structure and signaling, that may promote these distinct mutation patterns and differential coupling to specific cancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tokheim, Collin J</author><author>Papadopoulos, Nickolas</author><author>Kinzler, Kenneth W</author><author>Vogelstein, Bert</author><author>Karchin, Rachel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the evaluation of cancer driver genes.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>14330-14335</pages><volume>113</volume><issue>50</issue><keywords><keyword>DNA sequencing</keyword><keyword>cancer genomics</keyword><keyword>cancer mutations</keyword><keyword>computational method evaluation</keyword><keyword>driver genes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>10916490 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>27911828</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1616440113</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Tokheim et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Evaluating the evaluation of c.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1616440113</url><url>http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1616440113</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27911828</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5167163</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Sequencing has identified millions of somatic mutations in human cancers, but distinguishing cancer driver genes remains a major challenge. Numerous methods have been developed to identify driver genes, but evaluation of the performance of these methods is hindered by the lack of a gold standard, that is, bona fide driver gene mutations. Here, we establish an evaluation framework that can be applied to driver gene prediction methods. We used this framework to compare the performance of eight such methods. One of these methods, described here, incorporated a machine-learning-based ratiometric approach. We show that the driver genes predicted by each of the eight methods vary widely. Moreover, the P values reported by several of the methods were inconsistent with the uniform values expected, thus calling into question the assumptions that were used to generate them. Finally, we evaluated the potential effects of unexplained variability in mutation rates on false-positive driver gene predictions. Our analysis points to the strengths and weaknesses of each of the currently available methods and offers guidance for improving them in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vanunu, Oron</author><author>Magger, Oded</author><author>Ruppin, Eytan</author><author>Shlomi, Tomer</author><author>Sharan, Roded</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Associating genes and protein complexes with disease via network propagation.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1000641</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1553-7358 (Electronic)\r1553-734X (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>20090828</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641</electronic-resource-num><notes>[5] - review of grouping genes

Recently, several studies have tackled this challenge via a network-based approach, motivated by the observation that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend to lie close to one another in a network of protein-protein or functional interactions. However, most of these approaches use only local network information in the inference process and are restricted to inferring single gene associations. Here, we provide a global, network-based method for prioritizing disease genes and inferring protein complex associations, which we call PRINCE. The method is based on formulating constraints on the prioritization function that relate to its smoothness over the network and usage of prior information. We exploit this function to predict not only genes but also protein complex associations with a disease of interest. We test our method on gene-disease association data, evaluating both the prioritization achieved and the protein complexes inferred. We show that our method outperforms extant approaches in both tasks. Using data on 1,369 diseases from the OMIM knowledgebase, our method is able (in a cross validation setting) to rank the true causal gene first for 34% of the diseases, and infer 139 disease-related complexes that are highly coherent in terms of the function, expression and conservation of their member proteins. Importantly, we apply our method to study three multi-factorial diseases for which some causal genes have been found already: prostate cancer, alzheimer and type 2 diabetes mellitus. PRINCE's predictions for these diseases highly match the known literature, suggesting several novel causal genes and protein complexes for further investigation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biran, Hadas</author><author>Kupiec, Martin</author><author>Sharan, Roded</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative Analysis of Normalization Methods for Network Propagation</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>degree-preserving randomization</keyword><keyword>gene prioritization</keyword><keyword>network diffusion</keyword><keyword>network diffusion, protein–protein interaction net</keyword><keyword>p -value computation</keyword><keyword>protein</keyword><keyword>protein interaction network</keyword><keyword>telomere length maintenance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fgene.2019.00004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Biran, Kupiec, Sharan - Frontiers in Genetics - Comparative Analysis of Normalization Methods for Network Propagation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2019.00004/full</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Deng, Lei</author><author>Wang, Jiacheng</author><author>Zhang, Jingpu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting Gene Ontology Function of Human MicroRNAs by Integrating Multiple Networks</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>global heterogeneous network</keyword><keyword>latent</keyword><keyword>miRNA function annotation, miRNA co-expression, gl</keyword><keyword>mirna co-expression</keyword><keyword>mirna function annotation</keyword><keyword>multi-classification</keyword><keyword>representations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fgene.2019.00003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Deng, Wang, Zhang - Frontiers in Genetics - Predicting Gene Ontology Function of Human MicroRNAs by Integrating Multiple Networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2019.00003/full</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luo, Ping</author><author>Ding, Yulian</author><author>Lei, Xiujuan</author><author>Wu, Fang-Xiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>deepDriver: Predicting Cancer Driver Genes Based on Somatic Mutations Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>cancer mutations</keyword><keyword>convolutional neural networks</keyword><keyword>deep learning</keyword><keyword>deep learning, convolutional neural networks, driv</keyword><keyword>driver gene prediction</keyword><keyword>gene similarity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fgene.2019.00013</electronic-resource-num><notes>Use a CNN to predict driver genes

Although defects in niche and stem cell behavior have been implicated in promoting age-related decline, the causes of early-onset aging defects are unknown. We have identified an early consequence of aging in germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila testis. Aging disrupts the unique program of GSC cytokinesis, with GSCs failing to abscise from their daughter cells. Abscission failure significantly disrupts both self-renewal and the generation of differentiating germ cells. Extensive live imaging and genetic analyses show that abscission failure is due to inappropriate retention of F-actin at the intercellular bridges between GSC-daughter cells. Furthermore, F-actin is regulated by the Jak/STAT pathway-increasing or decreasing pathway activity can rescue or exacerbate the age-induced abscission defect, respectively. Even subtle decreases to STAT activity are sufficient to precociously age young GSCs and induce abscission failure. Thus, this work has identified the earliest age-related defect in GSCs and has revealed a unique role for an established niche signaling pathway in controlling stem cell cytokinesis and in regulating stem cell behavior with age.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leto, Dara E</author><author>Morgens, David W</author><author>Zhang, Lichao</author><author>Walczak, Christopher P</author><author>Elias, Joshua E</author><author>Bassik, Michael C</author><author>Kopito, Ron R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide CRISPR Analysis Identifies Substrate-Specific Conjugation Modules in ER-Associated Degradation.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cell</full-title></periodical><pages>377-389.e11</pages><volume>73</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30581143</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molcel.2018.11.015</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Leto et al. - Molecular cell - Genome-wide CRISPR Analysis Identifies Substrate-Specific Conjugation Modules in ER-Associated Deg.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.11.015</url><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276518309857?dgcid=rss_sd_all</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30581143</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6338494</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) maintains the integrity of the proteome by selectively degrading misfolded or mis-assembled proteins, but the rules that govern how conformationally defective proteins in the secretory pathway are selected from the structurally and topologically diverse constellation of correctly folded membrane and secretory proteins for efficient degradation by cytosolic proteasomes is not well understood.

Its activity is tightly regulated by both diffusible chemical ligands and mechanical stimuli. The pathway consists of a series of kinases that can control the sub-cellular localization and stability of YAP or TAZ, homologous transcriptional co-factors. Caveolae, small (60-100 nm) bulb-like invaginations of the plasma membrane, are comprised predominantly of caveolin and cavin proteins and can respond to mechanical stimuli. Here, we show that YAP/TAZ, the major transcriptional mediators of the Hippo pathway, are critical for expression of caveolae components and therefore caveolae formation in both mammalian cells and zebrafish. In essence, without YAP/TAZ, the cell loses an entire organelle. CAVEOLIN1 and CAVIN1, the two essential caveolar genes, are direct target genes of YAP/TAZ, regulated via TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors. Notably, YAP/TAZ become nuclear enriched and facilitate target gene transcription in cells with diminished levels of caveolae. Furthermore, caveolar-mediated shear stress response activates YAP/TAZ. These data link caveolae to Hippo signaling in the context of cellular responses to mechanical stimuli and suggest activity-based feedback regulation between components of caveolae and the outputs of the Hippo pathway.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hiramatsu, Yukiko</author><author>Fukuda, Akihisa</author><author>Ogawa, Satoshi</author><author>Goto, Norihiro</author><author>Ikuta, Kozo</author><author>Tsuda, Motoyuki</author><author>Matsumoto, Yoshihide</author><author>Kimura, Yoshito</author><author>Yoshioka, Takuto</author><author>Takada, Yutaka</author><author>Maruno, Takahisa</author><author>Hanyu, Yuta</author><author>Tsuruyama, Tatsuaki</author><author>Wang, Zhong</author><author>Akiyama, Haruhiko</author><author>Takaishi, Shigeo</author><author>Miyoshi, Hiroyuki</author><author>Taketo, Makoto Mark</author><author>Chiba, Tsutomu</author><author>Seno, Hiroshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Arid1a is essential for intestinal stem cells through Sox9 regulation.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>1704-1713</pages><volume>116</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Arid1a</keyword><keyword>homeostasis</keyword><keyword>intestinal stem cell</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>PNAS</publisher><accession-num>30635419</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1804858116</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Hiramatsu et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Arid1a is essential for inte.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/5/1704.full.pdf</url><url>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles/~3/CEE59MaDTog/1804858116.short</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30635419</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Inactivating mutations of Arid1a, a subunit of the Switch/sucrose nonfermentable chromatin remodeling complex, have been reported in multiple human cancers. Intestinal deletion of Arid1a has been reported to induce colorectal cancer in mice; however, its functional role in intestinal homeostasis remains unclear. We investigated the functional role of Arid1a in intestinal homeostasis in mice. We found that intestinal deletion of Arid1a results in loss of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), decreased Paneth and goblet cells, disorganized crypt-villous structures, and increased apoptosis in adult mice. Spheroids did not develop from intestinal epithelial cells deficient for Arid1a Lineage-tracing experiments revealed that Arid1a deletion in Lgr5+ ISCs leads to impaired self-renewal of Lgr5+ ISCs but does not perturb intestinal homeostasis. The Wnt signaling pathway, including Wnt agonists, receptors, and target genes, was strikingly down-regulated in Arid1a-deficient intestines. We found that Arid1a directly binds to the Sox9 promoter to support its expression. Remarkably, overexpression of Sox9 in intestinal epithelial cells abrogated the above phenotypes, although Sox9 overexpression in intestinal epithelial cells did not restore the expression levels of Wnt agonist and receptor genes. Furthermore, Sox9 overexpression permitted development of spheroids from Arid1a-deficient intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, deletion of Arid1a concomitant with Sox9 overexpression in Lgr5+ ISCs restores self-renewal in Arid1a-deleted Lgr5+ ISCs. These results indicate that Arid1a is indispensable for the maintenance of ISCs and intestinal homeostasis in mice. Mechanistically, this is mainly mediated by Sox9. Our data provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying maintenance of ISCs and intestinal homeostasis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rakocevic, Goran</author><author>Semenyuk, Vladimir</author><author>Lee, Wan-Ping</author><author>Spencer, James</author><author>Browning, John</author><author>Johnson, Ivan J</author><author>Arsenijevic, Vladan</author><author>Nadj, Jelena</author><author>Ghose, Kaushik</author><author>Suciu, Maria C</author><author>Ji, Sun-Gou</author><author>Demir, Gülfem</author><author>Li, Lizao</author><author>Toptaş, Berke Ç</author><author>Dolgoborodov, Alexey</author><author>Pollex, Björn</author><author>Spulber, Iosif</author><author>Glotova, Irina</author><author>Kómár, Péter</author><author>Stachyra, Andrew L</author><author>Li, Yilong</author><author>Popovic, Milos</author><author>Källberg, Morten</author><author>Jain, Amit</author><author>Kural, Deniz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fast and accurate genomic analyses using genome graphs.</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>354-362</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30643257</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41588-018-0316-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Rakocevic et al. - Nature genetics - Fast and accurate genomic analyses using genome graphs.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0316-4</url><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/20/194530</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30643257</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The human reference genome serves as the foundation for genomics by providing a scaffold for alignment of sequencing reads, but currently only reflects a single consensus haplotype, thus impairing analysis accuracy. Here we present a graph reference genome implementation that enables read alignment across 2,800 diploid genomes encompassing 12.6 million SNPs and 4.0 million insertions and deletions (indels). The pipeline processes one whole-genome sequencing sample in 6.5 h using a system with 36 CPU cores. We show that using a graph genome reference improves read mapping sensitivity and produces a 0.5% increase in variant calling recall, with unaffected specificity. Structural variations incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework. Finally, we show that iterative augmentation of graph genomes yields incremental gains in variant calling accuracy. Our implementation is an important advance toward fulfilling the promise of graph genomes to radically enhance the scalability and accuracy of genomic analyses.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Audano, Peter A</author><author>Sulovari, Arvis</author><author>Graves-Lindsay, Tina A</author><author>Cantsilieris, Stuart</author><author>Sorensen, Melanie</author><author>Welch, Annemarie E</author><author>Dougherty, Max L</author><author>Nelson, Bradley J</author><author>Shah, Ankeeta</author><author>Dutcher, Susan K</author><author>Warren, Wesley C</author><author>Magrini, Vincent</author><author>McGrath, Sean D.</author><author>Li, Yang I</author><author>Wilson, Richard K</author><author>Eichler, Evan E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterizing the Major Structural Variant Alleles of the Human Genome.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>663-675.e19</pages><volume>176</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>gap closure</keyword><keyword>human reference genome</keyword><keyword>major allele</keyword><keyword>real-time (SMRT) sequencing</keyword><keyword>single-molecule</keyword><keyword>structural variation</keyword><keyword>whole-genome sequence and assembly</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30661756</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.019</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Audano et al. - Cell - Characterizing the Major Structural Variant Alleles of the Human Genome.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.019</url><url>https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)31633-7</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30661756</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In order to provide a comprehensive resource for human structural variants (SVs), we generated long-read sequence data and analyzed SVs for fifteen human genomes. We sequence resolved 99,604 insertions, deletions, and inversions including 2,238 (1.6 Mbp) that are shared among all discovery genomes with an additional 13,053 (6.9 Mbp) present in the majority, indicating minor alleles or errors in the reference. Genotyping in 440 additional genomes confirms the most common SVs in unique euchromatin are now sequence resolved. We report a ninefold SV bias toward the last 5 Mbp of human chromosomes with nearly 55% of all VNTRs (variable number of tandem repeats) mapping to this portion of the genome. We identify SVs affecting coding and noncoding regulatory loci improving annotation and interpretation of functional variation.

The poor clinical outlook is further exacerbated by a lack of effective targeted therapies for TNBC. Here we show that ectopic expression and therapeutic delivery of the secreted protein Tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-like 1 (Tinagl1) suppresses TNBC progression and metastasis through direct binding to integrin α5β1, αvβ1, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and subsequent simultaneous inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and EGFR signaling pathways. Moreover, Tinagl1 protein level is associated with good prognosis and reversely correlates with FAK and EGFR activation status in TNBC. Our results suggest Tinagl1 as a candidate therapeutic agent for TNBC by dual inhibition of integrin/FAK and EGFR signaling pathways.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ishay-Ronen, Dana</author><author>Diepenbruck, Maren</author><author>Kalathur, Ravi Kiran Reddy</author><author>Sugiyama, Nami</author><author>Tiede, Stefanie</author><author>Ivanek, Robert</author><author>Bantug, Glenn</author><author>Morini, Marco Francesco</author><author>Wang, Junrong</author><author>Hess, Christoph</author><author>Christofori, Gerhard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gain Fat-Lose Metastasis: Converting Invasive Breast Cancer Cells into Adipocytes Inhibits Cancer Metastasis.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>17-32.e6</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>EMT</keyword><keyword>TGFβ-signaling</keyword><keyword>adipocyte</keyword><keyword>adipogenesis</keyword><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>cell plasticity</keyword><keyword>differentiation therapy</keyword><keyword>invasion</keyword><keyword>metastasis</keyword><keyword>trans-differentiation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30645973</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2018.12.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Ishay-Ronen et al. - Cancer cell - Gain Fat-Lose Metastasis Converting Invasive Breast Cancer Cells into Adipocytes Inhibits Canc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2018.12.002</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30645973</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancer cell plasticity facilitates the development of therapy resistance and malignant progression. De-differentiation processes, such as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), are known to enhance cellular plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that cancer cell plasticity can be exploited therapeutically by forcing the trans-differentiation of EMT-derived breast cancer cells into post-mitotic and functional adipocytes. Delineation of the molecular pathways underlying such trans-differentiation has motivated a combination therapy with MEK inhibitors and the anti-diabetic drug Rosiglitazone in various mouse models of murine and human breast cancer in vivo. This combination therapy provokes the conversion of invasive and disseminating cancer cells into post-mitotic adipocytes leading to the repression of primary tumor invasion and metastasis formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weyandt, Jamie D</author><author>Carney, John M</author><author>Pavlisko, Elizabeth N</author><author>Xu, Meng Meng</author><author>Counter, Christopher M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Isoform-Specific effects of wild-type ras genes on carcinogen-Induced lung tumorigenesis in mice</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27911940</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0167205</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Weyandt et al. - PLoS ONE - Isoform-Specific effects of wild-type ras genes on carcinogen-Induced lung tumorigenesis in mice.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167205&amp;type=printable</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The gene KRAS is commonly mutated in lung cancer to encode a constitutively active and oncogenic protein that is well established to initiate and maintain lung tumorigenesis. However , the remaining wild-type KRAS protein, or the other family members HRAS and NRAS, can still be activated in the presence of oncogenic KRAS. Moreover, loss of any one of these three genes has been shown to increase the sensitivity of mice to the carcinogen ure-thane, which induces Kras mutation-positive early lung lesions. To determine the contribution of progressively disrupting Hras and Nras genes on urethane lung tumorigenesis, mice with different combinations of wild-type and null alleles of Hras and Nras were exposed with urethane and tumor burden was assessed. As previously reported, loss of one allele of Hras increased the sensitivity of mice to this carcinogen, and this effect was further exacerbated by the loss of the second Hras allele. However, loss of one or both alleles of Nras failed to alter tumor burden, either in the absence or presence of Hras, after exposure to urethane. Additionally, no obvious difference between lung lesions in mice with wild-type versus null alleles was detected, suggesting that wild-type Ras proteins may exert a tumor suppressive effects at the time of initiation, although other interpretations are certainly possible. In summary , these data suggest that in some genetic backgrounds inactivation of different wild-type Ras genes can have different effects on urethane-induced lung tumorigenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Drosten, Matthias</author><author>Simón-Carrasco, Lucía</author><author>Hernández-Porras, Isabel</author><author>Lechuga, Carmen G</author><author>Blasco, María T</author><author>Jacob, Harrys K C</author><author>Fabbiano, Salvatore</author><author>Potenza, Nicoletta</author><author>Bustelo, Xosé R</author><author>Guerra, Carmen</author><author>Barbacid, Mariano</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>H-Ras and K-Ras Oncoproteins Induce Different Tumor Spectra When Driven by the Same Regulatory Sequences.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>707-718</pages><volume>77</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>27872088</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-2925</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Drosten et al. - Cancer research - H-Ras and K-Ras Oncoproteins Induce Different Tumor Spectra When Driven by the Same Regulatory.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27872088</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Genetic studies in mice have provided evidence that H-Ras and K-Ras proteins are bioequivalent. However, human tumors display marked differences in the association of RAS oncogenes with tumor type. Thus, to further assess the bioequivalence of oncogenic H-Ras and K-Ras, we replaced the coding region of the murine K-Ras locus with H-RasG12V oncogene sequences. Germline expression of H-RasG12V or K-RasG12V from the K-Ras locus resulted in embryonic lethality. However, expression of these genes in adult mice led to different tumor phenotypes. Whereas H-RasG12V elicited papillomas and hematopoietic tumors, K-RasG12V induced lung tumors and gastric lesions. Pulmonary expression of H-RasG12V created a senescence-like state caused by excessive MAPK signaling. Likewise, H-RasG12V but not K-RasG12V induced senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Label-free quantitative analysis revealed that minor differences in H-RasG12V expression levels led to drastically different biological outputs, suggesting that subtle differences in MAPK signaling confer nonequivalent functions that influence tumor spectra induced by RAS oncoproteins.

Of six genes contained in a conserved haplotype, three (Casc1, Kras and Ifltd1) have been proposed as Pas1 candidates, but mechanistic evidence is sparse. Herein, we examined urethane-induced lung tumorigenesis in a new mouse model developed by replacing the Kras gene with an Hras gene in the susceptible A/J-type Pas1 locus and crossing these mice with either C57BL/6J or A/J mice. Heterozygous mice carrying the Hras-replacement gene were more susceptible than wild-type mice to lung carcinogenesis, indicating that Hras replacement not only compensates for Kras functions, but is more active. Indeed, most lung tumors carried a Gln61Leu mutation in the Hras-replacement gene, whereas no mutations were observed in the endogenous Hras gene. Thus, the context of the Kras locus determined mutability of ras genes. In mice carrying the Hras-replacement gene, the mutation frequency affecting the wild-type Kras gene was much higher when this gene was located in the A/J type than in the C57BL/6J-type Pas1 locus (12 versus 0%, -log P=5.0). These findings identify cis-acting elements in the Pas1 locus as the functional components controlling genetic susceptibility to lung tumorigenesis by modulating mutability of the Kras gene.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shema, Efrat</author><author>Bernstein, Bradley E</author><author>Buenrostro, Jason D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell and single-molecule epigenomics to uncover genome regulation at unprecedented resolution.</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>19-25</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30559489</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41588-018-0290-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Shema, Bernstein, Buenrostro - Nature genetics - Single-cell and single-molecule epigenomics to uncover genome regulation at unpr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0290-x</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0290-x</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559489</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Recent advances in single-cell and single-molecule epigenomic technologies now enable the study of genome regulation and dynamics at unprecedented resolution.

To handle this, a method based on disjoint subgraphs in a graph whose nodes are the quantified RNAs is proposed. Edges in the graph are defined by lack of change in ratios of the corresponding RNAs between conditions. Results The methods is suited for qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq data analyses, and leads to easy-to-interpret, graphical results and the identification of set of genes that share a similar behavior when the studied condition changes. For qRT-PCR data, it has better statistical properties than the common ΔΔCq method.

A repository of well-validated high-quality protein-protein interactions can be used in both large- and small-scale studies to generate and validate a wide range of functional hypotheses. RESULTS We develop HINT (http://hint.yulab.org) - a database of high-quality protein-protein interactomes for human, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Oryza sativa. These were collected from several databases and filtered both systematically and manually to remove low-quality/erroneous interactions. The resulting datasets are classified by type (binary physical interactions vs. co-complex associations) and data source (high-throughput systematic setups vs. literature-curated small-scale experiments). We find strong sociological sampling biases in literature-curated datasets of small-scale interactions. An interactome without such sampling biases was used to understand network properties of human disease-genes - hubs are unlikely to cause disease, but if they do, they usually cause multiple disorders. CONCLUSIONS HINT is of significant interest to researchers in all fields of biology as it addresses the ubiquitous need of having a repository of high-quality protein-protein interactions. These datasets can be utilized to generate specific hypotheses about specific proteins and/or pathways, as well as analyzing global properties of cellular networks. HINT will be regularly updated and all versions will be tracked.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Janakiraman, Manickam</author><author>Vakiani, Efsevia</author><author>Zeng, Zhaoshi</author><author>Pratilas, Christine A.</author><author>Taylor, Barry S.</author><author>Chitale, Dhananjay</author><author>Halilovic, Ensar</author><author>Wilson, Manda</author><author>Huberman, Kety</author><author>Ricarte Filho, Julio Cezar</author><author>Persaud, Yogindra</author><author>Levine, Douglas A.</author><author>Fagin, James A.</author><author>Jhanwar, Suresh C.</author><author>Mariadason, John M.</author><author>Lash, Alex</author><author>Ladanyi, Marc</author><author>Saltz, Leonard B.</author><author>Heguy, Adriana</author><author>Paty, Philip B.</author><author>Solit, David B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic and biological characterization of exon 4 KRAS mutations in human cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>5901-11</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>0008-5472</isbn><accession-num>20570890</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0192</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Janakiraman et al. - Cancer research - Genomic and biological characterization of exon 4 KRAS mutations in human cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20570890</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2943514</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mutations in RAS proteins occur widely in human cancer. Prompted by the confirmation of KRAS mutation as a predictive biomarker of response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies, limited clinical testing for RAS pathway mutations has recently been adopted. We performed a multiplatform genomic analysis to characterize, in a nonbiased manner, the biological, biochemical, and prognostic significance of Ras pathway alterations in colorectal tumors and other solid tumor malignancies. Mutations in exon 4 of KRAS were found to occur commonly and to predict for a more favorable clinical outcome in patients with colorectal cancer. Exon 4 KRAS mutations, all of which were identified at amino acid residues K117 and A146, were associated with lower levels of GTP-bound RAS in isogenic models. These same mutations were also often accompanied by conversion to homozygosity and increased gene copy number, in human tumors and tumor cell lines. Models harboring exon 4 KRAS mutations exhibited mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase dependence and resistance to EGFR-targeted agents. Our findings suggest that RAS mutation is not a binary variable in tumors, and that the diversity in mutant alleles and variability in gene copy number may also contribute to the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes observed in cancer patients. These results also provide a rationale for broader KRAS testing beyond the most common hotspot alleles in exons 2 and 3.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Edkins, Sarah</author><author>O'Meara, Sarah</author><author>Parker, Adrian</author><author>Stevens, Claire</author><author>Reis, Marcelo</author><author>Jones, Siân</author><author>Greenman, Chris</author><author>Davies, Helen</author><author>Dalgliesh, Gillian</author><author>Forbes, Simon</author><author>Hunter, Chris</author><author>Smith, Raffaella</author><author>Stephens, Philip</author><author>Goldstraw, Peter</author><author>Nicholson, Andrew</author><author>Chan, Tsun Leung</author><author>Velculescu, Victor E</author><author>Yuen, Siu Tsan</author><author>Leung, Suet Yi</author><author>Stratton, Michael R</author><author>Futreal, P Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recurrent KRAS codon 146 mutations in human colorectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cancer biology &amp; therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer biology &amp; therapy</full-title></periodical><pages>928-32</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>A146</keyword><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Colorectal</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>1538-4047 (Print)\n1538-4047 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>16969076</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4161/cbt.5.8.3251</electronic-resource-num><notes>This may be the original paper to find A146 mutations in CRC</notes><research-notes>This may be the original paper to find A146 mutations in CRC</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2006 - Edkins et al. - Cancer biology &amp; therapy - Recurrent KRAS codon 146 mutations in human colorectal cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16969076</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2714972</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>An activating point mutation in codon 12 of the HRAS gene was the first somatic point mutation identified in a human cancer and established the role of somatic mutations as the common driver of oncogenesis. Since then, there have been over 11,000 mutations in the three RAS (HRAS, KRAS and NRAS) genes in codons 12, 13 and 61 reported in the literature. We report here the identification of recurrent somatic missense mutations at alanine 146, a highly conserved residue in the guanine nucleotide binding domain. In two independent series of colorectal cancers from Hong Kong and the United States we detected KRAS A146 mutations in 7/126 and 2/94 cases, respectively, giving a combined frequency of 4%. We also detected KRAS A146 mutations in 2/40 (5%) colorectal cell lines, including the NCI-60 colorectal cancer line HCC2998. Codon 146 mutations thus are likely to make an equal or greater contribution to colorectal cancer than codon 61 mutations (4.2% in our combined series, 1% in the literature). Lung adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas did not show codon 146 mutations. We did, however, identify a KRAS A146 mutation in the ML-2 acute myeloid leukemia cell line and an NRAS A146 mutation in the NALM-6 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line, suggesting that the contribution of codon 146 mutations is not entirely restricted to colorectal cancers or to KRAS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McFall, Thomas</author><author>Diedrich, Jolene K</author><author>Mengistu, Meron</author><author>Littlechild, Stacy L</author><author>Paskvan, Kendra V</author><author>Sisk-Hackworth, Laura</author><author>Moresco, James J</author><author>Shaw, Andrey S</author><author>Stites, Edward C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Systems Mechanism for KRAS Mutant Allele Specific Responses to Targeted Therapy</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/491621</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - McFall et al. - bioRxiv - A Systems Mechanism for KRAS Mutant Allele Specific Responses to Targeted Therapy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/491621</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A well-established genotype to phenotype relationship in genomic medicine is that activating KRAS mutations indicate resistance to anti-EGFR agents. We used a computational model of Ras signaling to investigate a confusing exception to this relationship whereby colorectal cancers with one specific, constitutively-active, mutant, KRAS G13D, respond to anti- EGFR agents. Our computational simulations of the biochemical processes that regulate Ras suggest EGFR inhibition reduces wild-type Ras activation in KRAS G13D mutant cancer cells more than in other KRAS mutant cancer cells. The model also reveals a non-intuitive, mutant- specific, dependency of wild-type Ras activation on EGFR. This dependency is determined by the interaction strength between a KRAS mutant and tumor suppressor neurofibromin. Our prospective experiments confirm this mechanism that arises from the systems-level regulation of Ras pathway signaling. Overall, our work demonstrates how systems approaches enable mechanism-based inference in genomic medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spoerner, Michael</author><author>Wittinghofer, Alfred</author><author>Kalbitzer, Hans Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Perturbation of the conformational equilibria in Ras by selective mutations as studied by 31P NMR spectroscopy.</title><secondary-title>FEBS letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FEBS letters</full-title></periodical><pages>305-10</pages><volume>578</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>31P NMR spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>Conformational dynamics</keyword><keyword>Effector interaction</keyword><keyword>Ras</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><isbn>00145793</isbn><accession-num>15589837</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.febslet.2004.11.020</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2004 - Spoerner, Wittinghofer, Kalbitzer - FEBS letters - Perturbation of the conformational equilibria in Ras by selective mutations as.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0014579304013845/1-s2.0-S0014579304013845-main.pdf?_tid=af4af0ec-00b6-4849-93c4-99c8dff0742e&amp;acdnat=1548338901_85cd6af55e3e8b6cdf0a78d9bea10d0c</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15589837</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Ras regulates a variety of different signal transduction pathways acting as molecular switch.

The relative population between the two conformational states affects drastically the affinity of Ras to its effectors. (31)P NMR spectroscopy shows that the conformational equilibrium can be shifted specifically by point mutations, including mutations with oncogenic potential, thus modifying the effector interactions and their coupling to dynamic properties of the protein.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barbacid, Mariano</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ras genes.</title><secondary-title>Annual review of biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual review of biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>779-827</pages><volume>56</volume><keywords/><dates><year>1987</year></dates><accession-num>3304147</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev.bi.56.070187.004023</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://1987 - Barbacid - Annual review of biochemistry - ras genes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3304147</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Winters, Ian P</author><author>Chiou, Shin-Heng</author><author>Paulk, Nicole K</author><author>McFarland, Christopher D.</author><author>Lalgudi, Pranav V</author><author>Ma, Rosanna K</author><author>Lisowski, Leszek</author><author>Connolly, Andrew J</author><author>Petrov, Dmitri A</author><author>Kay, Mark A</author><author>Winslow, Monte M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiplexed in vivo homology-directed repair and tumor barcoding enables parallel quantification of Kras variant oncogenicity.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>2053</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>2041-1723 (Electronic) 2041-1723 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>29233960</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-017-01519-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Winters et al. - Nature communications - Multiplexed in vivo homology-directed repair and tumor barcoding enables parallel quanti.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/naturecommunications</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233960</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5727199</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Large-scale genomic analyses of human cancers have cataloged somatic point mutations thought to initiate tumor development and sustain cancer growth. However, determining the functional significance of specific alterations remains a major bottleneck in our understanding of the genetic determinants of cancer. Here, we present a platform that integrates multiplexed AAV/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) with DNA barcoding and high-throughput sequencing to simultaneously investigate multiple genomic alterations in de novo cancers in mice. Using this approach, we introduce a barcoded library of non-synonymous mutations into hotspot codons 12 and 13 of Kras in adult somatic cells to initiate tumors in the lung, pancreas, and muscle. High-throughput sequencing of barcoded Kras HDR alleles from bulk lung and pancreas reveals surprising diversity in Kras variant oncogenicity. Rapid, cost-effective, and quantitative approaches to simultaneously investigate the function of precise genomic alterations in vivo will help uncover novel biological and clinically actionable insights into carcinogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burd, Christin E.</author><author>Liu, Wenjin</author><author>Huynh, Minh V.</author><author>Waqas, Meriam A.</author><author>Gillahan, James E.</author><author>Clark, Kelly S.</author><author>Fu, Kailing</author><author>Martin, Brit L.</author><author>Jeck, William R.</author><author>Souroullas, George P.</author><author>Darr, David B.</author><author>Zedek, Daniel C.</author><author>Miley, Michael J.</author><author>Baguley, Bruce C.</author><author>Campbell, Sharon L.</author><author>Sharpless, Norman E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutation-specific RAS oncogenicity explains NRAS codon 61 selection in melanoma</title><secondary-title>Cancer Discovery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer Discovery</full-title></periodical><pages>1418-1429</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>2159-8290 (Electronic)\r2159-8274 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>25252692</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/2159-8290.CD-14-0729</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Burd et al. - Cancer Discovery - Mutation-specific RAS oncogenicity explains NRAS codon 61 selection in melanoma.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>UNLABELLED: NRAS mutation at codons 12, 13, or 61 is associated with transformation; yet, in melanoma, such alterations are nearly exclusive to codon 61. Here, we compared the melanoma susceptibility of an NrasQ61R knock-in allele to similarly designed KrasG12D and NrasG12D alleles. With concomitant p16INK4a inactivation, KrasG12D or NrasQ61R expression efficiently promoted melanoma in vivo, whereas NrasG12D did not. In addition, NrasQ61R mutation potently cooperated with Lkb1/Stk11 loss to induce highly metastatic disease. Functional comparisons of NrasQ61R and NrasG12D revealed little difference in the ability of these proteins to engage PI3K or RAF. Instead, NrasQ61R showed enhanced nucleotide binding, decreased intrinsic GTPase activity, and increased stability when compared with NrasG12D. This work identifies a faithful model of human NRAS-mutant melanoma, and suggests that the increased melanomagenecity of NrasQ61R over NrasG12D is due to heightened abundance of the active, GTP-bound form rather than differences in the engagement of downstream effector pathways.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: This work explains the curious predominance in human melanoma of mutations of codon 61 of NRAS over other oncogenic NRAS mutations. Using conditional &quot;knock-in&quot; mouse models, we show that physiologic expression of NRASQ61R, but not NRASG12D, drives melanoma formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, M.

Lack of robust func- tional assays has been amajor hurdle in RAS pathway-targeted drug development.We used NMR to obtain detailed mechanistic data on RAS cycling defects conferred by oncogenicmutations, or full-length RASopathy-derived regulatory proteins. By monitoring the confor- mation of wild-type and oncogenic RAS in real-time, we show that opposing properties integrate with regulators to hyperactivate on- cogenic RAS mutants. Q61L and G13D exhibited rapid nucleotide exchange and an unexpected susceptibility to GAP-mediated hydro- lysis, in direct contrast with G12V, indicating different approaches must be taken to inhibit these oncoproteins. An NMR methodology was established to directly monitor RAS cycling by intact, multido- main proteins encoded by RASopathy genes in mammalian cell extracts. By measuring GAP activity from tumor cells, we demon- strate how loss of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) increases RAS- GTP levels in NF1-derived cells.Wefurther applied thismethodology to profile Noonan Syndrome (NS)-derived SOS1mutants. Combining NMR with cell-based assays allowed us to differentiate defects in catalysis, allosteric regulation, andmembrane targeting of individual mutants, while revealing a membrane-dependent compensatory ef- fect that attenuates dramatic increases in RAS activation shown by Y337C, L550P, and I252T. Our NMR method presents a precise and robust measure of RAS activity, providing mechanistic insights that facilitate discovery of therapeutics targeted against the RAS signaling network.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Margonis, Georgios Antonios</author><author>Kim, Yuhree</author><author>Spolverato, Gaya</author><author>Ejaz, Aslam</author><author>Gupta, Rohan</author><author>Cosgrove, David</author><author>Anders, Robert</author><author>Karagkounis, Georgios</author><author>Choti, Michael A.</author><author>Pawlik, Timothy M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association Between Specific Mutations in KRAS Codon 12 and Colorectal Liver Metastasis.</title><secondary-title>JAMA surgery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA surgery</full-title></periodical><pages>722-9</pages><volume>150</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>2168-6254</isbn><accession-num>26038887</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jamasurg.2015.0313</electronic-resource-num><notes>G12V and G12S were prognositic of worse overall survival</notes><research-notes>G12V and G12S were prognositic of worse overall survival</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Margonis et al. - JAMA surgery - Association Between Specific Mutations in KRAS Codon 12 and Colorectal Liver Metastasis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038887</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4696064</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>IMPORTANCE Currently, one of the most commonly available biomarkers in the treatment of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS); however, the prognostic implications of specific mutations of the KRAS gene are still not well defined. OBJECTIVE To investigate the prognostic impact of specific KRAS mutations on patients undergoing liver resection for CRLM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective single-center study was conducted from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2013. Data about specific KRAS mutations for 331 patients who underwent hepatic resection for CRLM at Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2003 and 2013 were analyzed. Clinicopathological characteristics, perioperative details, and outcomes were stratified by specific KRAS mutation at codons 12 and 13. INTERVENTION Resection of CRLM. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS A mutated KRAS (mtKRAS) was identified in 91 patients (27.5%). At a median follow-up of 27.4 months, recurrence was observed in 48 patients (52.7%) with mtKRAS and 130 patients (54.2%) with wild-type KRAS (wtKRAS) (P = .82). Median and 5-year survival among patients with mtKRAS was 32.4 months and 32.7%, respectively, vs 58.5 months and 46.9%, respectively, for patients with wtKRAS (P = .02). Patients with KRAS codon 12 mutations had worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% CI, 1.05-2.27; P = .03) vs those with wtKRAS, whereas a KRAS codon 13 mutation was not associated with prognosis (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.83-2.62; P = .19). Among the 6 most common mutations in codons 12 and 13, only G12V (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.00-3.17; P = .05) and G12S (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.22-9.10; P = .02) were associated with worse OS compared with patients with wtKRAS (both P &lt; .05). Among patients who recurred, G12V (HR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.32-6.61; P = .01), G12C (HR, 6.74; 95% CI, 2.05-22.2; P = .002), and G12S mutations (HR, 4.91; 95% CI, 1.52-15.8; P = .01) were associated with worse OS (both P &lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE G12V and G12S mutations of codon 12 were independent prognostic factors of worse OS. Among patients who recurred after resection of CRLM, G12V, G12C, and G12S mutations were associated with worse OS. Information on specific KRAS mutations may help individualize therapeutic and surveillance strategies for patients with resected CRLM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bishehsari, Faraz</author><author>Zhang, Lijuan</author><author>Barlass, Usman</author><author>Preite, Nailliw Z.</author><author>Turturro, Sanja</author><author>Najor, Matthew S.</author><author>Shetuni, Brandon B.</author><author>Zayas, Janet P.</author><author>Mahdavinia, Mahboobeh</author><author>Abukhdeir, Abde M.</author><author>Keshavarzian, Ali</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KRAS mutation and epithelial–macrophage interplay in pancreatic neoplastic transformation</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>1994-2007</pages><volume>143</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>PEDF</keyword><keyword>macrophage</keyword><keyword>pancreas cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29756386</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ijc.31592</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Bishehsari et al. - International Journal of Cancer - KRAS mutation and epithelial–macrophage interplay in pancreatic neoplasti.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The measurement of contact angle on polystyrene (PS) films solvent\ncast on acid-cleaned glass substrates was used in conjunction with\nthe Lifshitz?van der Waals/acid?base approach in order to investigate\nthe surface functional-group compositions as well as the physical\nnature and the strength of intermolecular interactions between the\nfilm surfaces and various testing liquids.

In addition, colon tumors carrying K-ras codon 12 mutations associate with lower levels of apoptosis than tumors lacking this mutation. To test the hypothesis of a distinct transforming capacity of different K-ras forms in an in vitro system, we generated stable transfectants of NIH3T3 cells expressing a plasmid containing K-ras mutated at codon 12 (K12) or at codon 13 (K13), or overexpressing the K-ras proto-oncogene (Kwt-oe). We evaluated changes in morphology, proliferative capacity, contact inhibition, and predisposition to apoptosis and anchorage-independent growth in K12, K13, and Kwt-oe transformants. In addition, we studied alterations in expression and/or activation of proteins that participate in signal transduction downstream of Ras or are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell-cell (E-cadherin and beta-catenin) and cell-substrate (focal adhesion kinase) interactions. We observed that K13 or Kwt-oe transformants died synchronically 24-48 h after reaching confluency. Their death was apoptotic. In contrast, K12 grew, forming bigger colonies with higher cell densities; and before reaching confluency, spontaneously formed spheroids and showed no sign of apoptosis. The enhanced resistance to apoptosis, loss of contact inhibition, and predisposition to anchorage-independent growth in the K12 transformants were associated with higher AKT/protein kinase B activation, bcl-2, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and focal adhesion kinase overexpression, and RhoA underexpression, whereas the increased sensitivity of K13 or Kwt-oe transformants to apoptosis was associated with increased activation of the c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase 1 pathway. All transformants showed a similar overactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and levels of bax expression similar to the endogenous level. Therefore, in our in vitro model, the localization of the mutation in the K-ras gene predisposes to a different level of aggressiveness in the transforming phenotype. K12 may increase aggressiveness not by altering proliferative pathways, but by the differential regulation of K-Ras downstream pathways that lead to inhibition of apoptosis, enhanced loss of contact inhibition, and increased predisposition to anchorage-independent growth. These results offer a molecular explanation for the increased aggressiveness of the tumors with K-ras codon 12 mutations observed in the clinical setting.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, Mark Steven</author><author>Miller, Lance D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RAS mutations and oncogenesis: Not all RAS mutations are created equally</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>JAN</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Ras</keyword><keyword>Tumorigenesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>1664-8021 (Electronic)\r1664-8021 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>22303394</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fgene.2011.00100</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Miller, Miller - Frontiers in Genetics - RAS mutations and oncogenesis Not all RAS mutations are created equally.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Mutation in RAS proteins is one of the most common genetic alterations observed in human and experimentally induced rodent cancers. In vivo, oncogenic mutations have been shown to occur at exons 12, 13, and 61, resulting in any 1 of 19 possible point mutations in a given tumor for a specific RAS isoform. While some studies have suggested a possible role of different mutant alleles in determining tumor severity and phenotype, no general consensus has emerged on the oncogenicity of different mutant alleles in tumor formation and progression. Part of this may be due to a lack of a single, signature pathway that shows significant alterations between different mutations. Rather, it is likely that subtle differences in the activation, or lack thereof, of downstream effectors by different RAS mutant alleles may determine the eventual outcome in terms of tumor phenotype. This paper reviews our current understanding of the potential role of different RAS mutations on tumorigenesis, highlights studies in model cell culture and in vivo systems, and discusses the potential of expression array and computational network modeling to dissect out differences in activated RAS genes in conferring a transforming phenotype.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buhrman, Greg</author><author>Wink, Glenna</author><author>Mattos, Carla</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transformation efficiency of RasQ61 mutants linked to structural features of the switch regions in the presence of Raf.</title><secondary-title>Structure (London, England : 1993)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Structure (London, England : 1993)</full-title></periodical><pages>1618-29</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>PROTEINS</keyword><keyword>SIGNALING</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>0969-2126 (Print)</isbn><accession-num>18073111</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.str.2007.10.011</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Buhrman, Wink, Mattos - Structure (London, England 1993) - Transformation efficiency of RasQ61 mutants linked to structural feat.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/S096921260700408X/1-s2.0-S096921260700408X-main.pdf?_tid=363f3c7a-e1ee-40af-ac4e-88c04c77e35f&amp;acdnat=1548270761_dbb115c22e3fad8e7b2008aeac06f294</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18073111</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articleren</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Transformation efficiencies of Ras mutants at residue 61 range over three orders of magnitude, but the in vitro GTPase activity decreases 10-fold for all mutants. We show that Raf impairs the GTPase activity of RasQ61L, suggesting that the Ras/Raf complex differentially modulates transformation. Our crystal structures show that, in transforming mutants, switch II takes part in a network of hydrophobic interactions burying the nucleotide and precatalytic water molecule. Our results suggest that Y32 and a water molecule bridging it to the gamma-phosphate in the wild-type structure play a role in GTP hydrolysis in lieu of the Arg finger in the absence of GAP. The bridging water molecule is absent in the transforming mutants, contributing to the burying of the nucleotide. We propose a mechanism for intrinsic hydrolysis in Raf-bound Ras and elucidate structural features in the Q61 mutants that correlate with their potency to transform cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bryant, Kirsten L</author><author>Mancias, Joseph D</author><author>Kimmelman, Alec C</author><author>Der, Channing J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KRAS: feeding pancreatic cancer proliferation.</title><secondary-title>Trends in biochemical sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in biochemical sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>91-100</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>autophagy</keyword><keyword>glutaminolysis</keyword><keyword>glycolysis</keyword><keyword>macropinocytosis</keyword><keyword>metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>0968-0004 (Electronic)\r0968-0004 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>24388967</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tibs.2013.12.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Bryant et al. - Trends in biochemical sciences - KRAS feeding pancreatic cancer proliferation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2013.12.004</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388967</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3955735</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Oncogenic KRAS mutation is the signature genetic event in the progression and growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), an almost universally fatal disease. Although it has been appreciated for some time that nearly 95% of PDAC harbor mutationally activated KRAS, to date no effective treatments that target this mutant protein have reached the clinic. A number of studies have shown that oncogenic KRAS plays a central role in controlling tumor metabolism by orchestrating multiple metabolic changes including stimulation of glucose uptake, differential channeling of glucose intermediates, reprogrammed glutamine metabolism, increased autophagy, and macropinocytosis. We review these recent findings and address how they may be applied to develop new PDAC treatments.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network</author><author>Weinstein, John N</author><author>Collisson, Eric A</author><author>Mills, Gordon B</author><author>Shaw, Kenna R Mills</author><author>Ozenberger, Brad A</author><author>Ellrott, Kyle</author><author>Shmulevich, Ilya</author><author>Sander, Chris</author><author>Stuart, Joshua M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer analysis project.</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1113-20</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>The Cancer Genome Atlas</keyword><keyword>Therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>doi:10.1038/ng.2764</isbn><accession-num>24071849</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng.2764</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al. - Nature genetics - The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer analysis project.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cancergenome.nih.gov/.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24071849</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3919969</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has profiled and analyzed large numbers of human tumors to discover molecular aberrations at the DNA, RNA, protein and epigenetic levels.

Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs.

However, few studies have realized that biological molecules are spatial-temporally regulated to form a dynamic cellular network and only a subset of interactions take place at the same location in cells. RESULTS In this study, considering the subcellular localization of proteins, we first construct a co-localization human protein interaction network (PIN) and systematically investigate the relationship between subcellular localization and biological functions. After that, we propose a Locational and Topological Overlap Model (LTOM) to preprocess the co-localization PIN to identify functional modules. LTOM requires the topological overlaps, the common partners shared by two proteins, to be annotated in the same localization as the two proteins. We observed the model has better correspondence with the reference protein complexes and shows more relevance to cancers based on both human and yeast datasets and two clustering algorithms, ClusterONE and MCL. CONCLUSION Taking into consideration of protein localization and topological overlap can improve the performance of module detection from protein interaction networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boca, Simina M</author><author>Kinzler, Kenneth W</author><author>Velculescu, Victor E</author><author>Vogelstein, Bert</author><author>Parmigiani, Giovanni</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Patient-oriented gene set analysis for cancer mutation data.</title><secondary-title>Genome biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome biology</full-title></periodical><pages>R112</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>10.1186/gb-2010-11-11-r112</isbn><accession-num>21092299</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/gb-2010-11-11-r112</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Boca et al. - Genome biology - Patient-oriented gene set analysis for cancer mutation data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/11/R112</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21092299</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3156951</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Recent research has revealed complex heterogeneous genomic landscapes in human cancers.

The synthetic lethal paradigm has provided a framework for the development of molecular targeted therapeutics that are functionally linked to the loss of specific TSG functions. In the course of genomic events that delete TSGs, a large number of genes with no apparent direct role in tumor promotion also sustain deletion as a result of chromosomal proximity to the target TSG. In this perspective, we review the novel concept of &quot;collateral lethality&quot;, which has served to identify cancer-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities resulting from co-deletion of passenger genes neighboring TSG. The large number of collaterally deleted genes, playing diverse functions in cell homeostasis, offers a rich repertoire of pharmacologically targetable vulnerabilities presenting novel opportunities for the development of personalized anti-neoplastic therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eleveld, Thomas F</author><author>Oldridge, Derek A</author><author>Bernard, Virginie</author><author>Koster, Jan</author><author>Colmet Daage, Léo</author><author>Diskin, Sharon J</author><author>Schild, Linda</author><author>Bentahar, Nadia Bessoltane</author><author>Bellini, Angela</author><author>Chicard, Mathieu</author><author>Lapouble, Eve</author><author>Combaret, Valérie</author><author>Legoix-Né, Patricia</author><author>Michon, Jean</author><author>Pugh, Trevor J</author><author>Hart, Lori S</author><author>Rader, JulieAnn</author><author>Attiyeh, Edward F</author><author>Wei, Jun S</author><author>Zhang, Shile</author><author>Naranjo, Arlene</author><author>Gastier-Foster, Julie M</author><author>Hogarty, Michael D</author><author>Asgharzadeh, Shahab</author><author>Smith, Malcolm A</author><author>Guidry Auvil, Jaime M</author><author>Watkins, Thomas B K</author><author>Zwijnenburg, Danny A</author><author>Ebus, Marli E</author><author>van Sluis, Peter</author><author>Hakkert, Anne</author><author>van Wezel, Esther</author><author>van der Schoot, C Ellen</author><author>Westerhout, Ellen M</author><author>Schulte, Johannes H</author><author>Tytgat, Godelieve A</author><author>Dolman, M.

The molecular basis of this aggressive phenotype is unknown. Whole-genome sequencing of 23 paired diagnostic and relapse neuroblastomas showed clonal evolution from the diagnostic tumor, with a median of 29 somatic mutations unique to the relapse sample. Eighteen of the 23 relapse tumors (78%) showed mutations predicted to activate the RAS-MAPK pathway. Seven of these events were detected only in the relapse tumor, whereas the others showed clonal enrichment. In neuroblastoma cell lines, we also detected a high frequency of activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway (11/18; 61%), and these lesions predicted sensitivity to MEK inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide a rationale for genetic characterization of relapse neuroblastomas and show that RAS-MAPK pathway mutations may function as a biomarker for new therapeutic approaches to refractory disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Favero, F.</author><author>Joshi, T.</author><author>Marquard, A.

However, analysis of such sequence data can be complicated by the presence of normal cells in the tumor specimen, by intratumor heterogeneity, and by the sheer size of the raw data. In particular, determination of copy number variations from exome sequencing data alone has proven difficult; thus, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have often been used for this task. Recently, algorithms to estimate absolute, but not allele-specific, copy number profiles from tumor sequencing data have been described. MATERIALS AND METHODS We developed Sequenza, a software package that uses paired tumor-normal DNA sequencing data to estimate tumor cellularity and ploidy, and to calculate allele-specific copy number profiles and mutation profiles. We applied Sequenza, as well as two previously published algorithms, to exome sequence data from 30 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We assessed the performance of these algorithms by comparing their results with those generated using matched SNP arrays and processed by the allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors (ASCAT) algorithm. RESULTS Comparison between Sequenza/exome and SNP/ASCAT revealed strong correlation in cellularity (Pearson's r = 0.90) and ploidy estimates (r = 0.42, or r = 0.94 after manual inspecting alternative solutions). This performance was noticeably superior to previously published algorithms. In addition, in artificial data simulating normal-tumor admixtures, Sequenza detected the correct ploidy in samples with tumor content as low as 30%. CONCLUSIONS The agreement between Sequenza and SNP array-based copy number profiles suggests that exome sequencing alone is sufficient not only for identifying small scale mutations but also for estimating cellularity and inferring DNA copy number aberrations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alexandrov, Ludmil B.</author><author>Nik-Zainal, Serena</author><author>Wedge, David C.</author><author>Aparicio, Samuel A J R</author><author>Behjati, Sam</author><author>Biankin, Andrew V.</author><author>Bignell, Graham R.</author><author>Bolli, Niccolò</author><author>Borg, Ake</author><author>Børresen-Dale, Anne-Lise</author><author>Boyault, Sandrine</author><author>Burkhardt, Birgit</author><author>Butler, Adam P.</author><author>Caldas, Carlos</author><author>Davies, Helen R.</author><author>Desmedt, Christine</author><author>Eils, Roland</author><author>Eyfjörd, Jórunn Erla</author><author>Foekens, John A.</author><author>Greaves, Mel</author><author>Hosoda, Fumie</author><author>Hutter, Barbara</author><author>Ilicic, Tomislav</author><author>Imbeaud, Sandrine</author><author>Imielinski, Marcin</author><author>Imielinsk, Marcin</author><author>Jäger, Natalie</author><author>Jones, David T W</author><author>Jones, David</author><author>Knappskog, Stian</author><author>Kool, Marcel</author><author>Lakhani, Sunil R.</author><author>López-Otín, Carlos</author><author>Martin, Sancha</author><author>Munshi, Nikhil C.</author><author>Nakamura, Hiromi</author><author>Northcott, Paul A.</author><author>Pajic, Marina</author><author>Papaemmanuil, Elli</author><author>Paradiso, Angelo</author><author>Pearson, John V.</author><author>Puente, Xose S.</author><author>Raine, Keiran</author><author>Ramakrishna, Manasa</author><author>Richardson, Andrea L.</author><author>Richter, Julia</author><author>Rosenstiel, Philip</author><author>Schlesner, Matthias</author><author>Schumacher, Ton N.</author><author>Span, Paul N.</author><author>Teague, Jon W.</author><author>Totoki, Yasushi</author><author>Tutt, Andrew N J</author><author>Valdés-Mas, Rafael</author><author>van Buuren, Marit M</author><author>van 't Veer, Laura</author><author>Vincent-Salomon, Anne</author><author>Waddell, Nicola</author><author>Yates, Lucy R.</author><author>Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative</author><author>ICGC Breast Cancer Consortium</author><author>ICGC MMML-Seq Consortium</author><author>ICGC PedBrain</author><author>Zucman-Rossi, Jessica</author><author>Futreal, P Andrew</author><author>McDermott, Ultan</author><author>Lichter, Peter</author><author>Meyerson, Matthew</author><author>Grimmond, Sean M.</author><author>Siebert, Reiner</author><author>Campo, Elías</author><author>Shibata, Tatsuhiro</author><author>Pfister, Stefan M.</author><author>Campbell, Peter J.</author><author>Stratton, Michael R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Signatures of mutational processes in human cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>415-21</pages><volume>500</volume><issue>7463</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><isbn>1476-4687 (Electronic)\r0028-0836 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>23945592</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature12477</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Alexandrov et al. - Nature - Signatures of mutational processes in human cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/nature12477</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23945592</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3776390</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wiesweg, Marcel</author><author>Kasper, Stefan</author><author>Worm, Karl</author><author>Herold, Thomas</author><author>Reis, Henning</author><author>Sara, Linda</author><author>Metzenmacher, Martin</author><author>Abendroth, Annalena</author><author>Darwiche, Kaid</author><author>Aigner, Clemens</author><author>Wedemeyer, Heiner H.</author><author>Helfritz, Fabian A.</author><author>Stuschke, Martin</author><author>Schumacher, Brigitte</author><author>Markus, Peter</author><author>Paul, Andreas</author><author>Rahmann, Sven</author><author>Schmid, Kurt W.</author><author>Schuler, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of RAS mutation subtype on clinical outcome-a cross-entity comparison of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>Oncogene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncogene</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><isbn>4138801806340</isbn><accession-num>30568222</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41388-018-0634-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Wiesweg et al. - Oncogene - Impact of RAS mutation subtype on clinical outcome-a cross-entity comparison of patients with advance.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-018-0634-0?utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=MKEF_USG_Researcher_inbound</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-018-0634-0</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30568222</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mutated RAS onco-proteins are key drivers across many cancers. The distribution of somatic RAS mutations varies between cancer entities. Retrospective analyses have associated some RAS mutations with distinct clinical outcomes. However, the clinical impact of the full spectrum of RAS mutations in their disease contextuality remains to be defined. To improve upon this situation, we studied genomically and clinically annotated, prospectively recruited cohorts of patients with RAS-mutated metastatic lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Mutational spectra were compared with predictions derived from analyzing the mutagenic impact at the genome level for each entity. Interestingly, we found concordance of predicted signatures with those actually observed in our patients. Thus, composition of the functionally active RAS mutational subtypes is primarily determined by the mutagenic context. Most RAS mutations seemed dominant oncogenic drivers with entity-dependent clinical outcomes. RAS comutations were enriched in tumors harboring class 2/3 BRAF mutations, highlighting the functional dependency of some mutated BRAF isoforms on RAS. With our dataset, we established a probabilistic model for cross-entity comparison of the prognostic impact of specific RAS mutational subtypes. The resulting prognostic clusters showed largely consistent clinical categorizations in both entities. This suggests mutant subtype-specific functional properties leading to similar clinical effects. A notable exception is KRAS G12C, which imparted an adverse prognosis only in colorectal cancer. Our findings provide a framework for risk stratification of specific RAS mutations across several cancer entities, which is required to guide the analysis of clinical findings in patients treated with direct RAS inhibitors or agents targeting downstream pathways.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Loo, Peter</author><author>Nordgard, Silje H.</author><author>Lingjærde, Ole Christian</author><author>Russnes, Hege G.</author><author>Rye, Inga H.</author><author>Sun, Wei</author><author>Weigman, Victor J.</author><author>Marynen, Peter</author><author>Zetterberg, Anders</author><author>Naume, Bjørn</author><author>Perou, Charles M.</author><author>Børresen-Dale, Anne-Lise</author><author>Kristensen, Vessela N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>16910-5</pages><volume>107</volume><issue>39</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1091-6490 (Electronic)\r0027-8424 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>20837533</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1009843107</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Van Loo et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Allele-specific copy number an.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1009843107/-/DCSupplemental.www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1009843107</url><url>http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1009843107</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20837533</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articleren</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We present an allele-specific copy number analysis of the in vivo breast cancer genome. We describe a unique bioinformatics approach, ASCAT (allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors), to accurately dissect the allele-specific copy number of solid tumors, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for both tumor ploidy and nonaberrant cell admixture. This allows calculation of &quot;ASCAT profiles&quot; (genome-wide allele-specific copy-number profiles) from which gains, losses, copy number-neutral events, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) can accurately be determined. In an early-stage breast carcinoma series, we observe aneuploidy (&gt;2.7n) in 45% of the cases and an average nonaberrant cell admixture of 49%. By aggregation of ASCAT profiles across our series, we obtain genomic frequency distributions of gains and losses, as well as genome-wide views of LOH and copy number-neutral events in breast cancer. In addition, the ASCAT profiles reveal differences in aberrant tumor cell fraction, ploidy, gains, losses, LOH, and copy number-neutral events between the five previously identified molecular breast cancer subtypes. Basal-like breast carcinomas have a significantly higher frequency of LOH compared with other subtypes, and their ASCAT profiles show large-scale loss of genomic material during tumor development, followed by a whole-genome duplication, resulting in near-triploid genomes. Finally, from the ASCAT profiles, we construct a genome-wide map of allelic skewness in breast cancer, indicating loci where one allele is preferentially lost, whereas the other allele is preferentially gained. We hypothesize that these alternative alleles have a different influence on breast carcinoma development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shen, Ronglai</author><author>Seshan, Venkatraman E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FACETS: allele-specific copy number and clonal heterogeneity analysis tool for high-throughput DNA sequencing.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>e131</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1362-4962 (Electronic) 0305-1048 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>27270079</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkw520</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Shen, Seshan - Nucleic acids research - FACETS allele-specific copy number and clonal heterogeneity analysis tool for high-throug.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/44/16/e131/2460163</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27270079</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5027494</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Allele-specific copy number analysis (ASCN) from next generation sequencing (NGS) data can greatly extend the utility of NGS beyond the identification of mutations to precisely annotate the genome for the detection of homozygous/heterozygous deletions, copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), allele-specific gains/amplifications. In addition, as targeted gene panels are increasingly used in clinical sequencing studies for the detection of 'actionable' mutations and copy number alterations to guide treatment decisions, accurate, tumor purity-, ploidy- and clonal heterogeneity-adjusted integer copy number calls are greatly needed to more reliably interpret NGS-based cancer gene copy number data in the context of clinical sequencing. We developed FACETS, an ASCN tool and open-source software with a broad application to whole genome, whole-exome, as well as targeted panel sequencing platforms. It is a fully integrated stand-alone pipeline that includes sequencing BAM file post-processing, joint segmentation of total- and allele-specific read counts, and integer copy number calls corrected for tumor purity, ploidy and clonal heterogeneity, with comprehensive output and integrated visualization. We demonstrate the application of FACETS using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole-exome sequencing of lung adenocarcinoma samples.

We performed preclinical trials investigating primary murine acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) generated by retroviral insertional mutagenesis in KrasG12D &quot;knockin&quot; mice with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (PD901). One outlier AML responded and exhibited intrinsic drug resistance at relapse. Loss of wild-type (WT) Kras enhanced the fitness of the dominant clone and rendered it sensitive to MEK inhibition. Similarly, human colorectal cancer cell lines with increased KRAS mutant allele frequency were more sensitive to MAP kinase inhibition, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated replacement of WT KRAS with a mutant allele sensitized heterozygous mutant HCT116 cells to treatment. In a prospectively characterized cohort of patients with advanced cancer, 642 of 1,168 (55%) with KRAS mutations exhibited allelic imbalance.

They are one of the most fundamental types of stochastic processes; can be used to model numerous phenomena, including diffusion, interactions, and opinions among humans and animals; and can be used to extract information about important entities or dense groups of entities in a network. Random walks have been studied for many decades on both regular lattices and (especially in the last couple of decades) on networks with a variety of structures. In the present article, we survey the theory and applications of random walks on networks, restricting ourselves to simple cases of single and non-adaptive random walkers. We distinguish three main types of random walks: discrete-time random walks, node-centric continuous-time random walks, and edge-centric continuous-time random walks. We first briefly survey random walks on a line, and then we consider random walks on various types of networks. We extensively discuss applications of random walks, including ranking of nodes (e.g., PageRank), community detection, respondent-driven sampling, and opinion models such as voter models.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carter, Hannah</author><author>Hofree, Matan</author><author>Ideker, Trey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genotype to phenotype via network analysis.</title><secondary-title>Current opinion in genetics &amp; development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current opinion in genetics &amp; development</full-title></periodical><pages>611-21</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>2122633255</isbn><accession-num>24238873</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.gde.2013.10.003</electronic-resource-num><notes>see [4], [25] for netwrok perturbation models

Here we review recent developments at the interface of biological networks and mutation analysis. We examine how mutations may be treated as a perturbation of the molecular interaction network and what insights may be gained from taking this perspective.

Although the presence of assembly gaps causes a slight reduction in the mapping rate in many experimental settings, that does not invalidate the typical statistical testing comparing read count distributions across experimental conditions. However, we hypothesize that not handling assembly gaps in the null model may confound statistical testing of co-localization of genomic features. Results: First, we performed a series of explorative analyses to understand whether and how the public genomic tracks intersect the assembly gaps track (hg19). The findings rightly confirm that the genomic regions in public genomic tracks intersect very little with assembly gaps and the intersection was observed only at the beginning and end regions of the assembly gaps rather than covering the whole gap sizes. Further, we simulated a set of query and reference genomic tracks in a way that nullified any dependence between them to test our hypothesis that not avoiding assembly gaps in the null model would result in spurious inflation of statistical significance. We then contrasted the distributions of test statistics and p-values of Monte Carlo simulation-based permutation tests that either avoided or not avoided assembly gaps in the null model when testing for significant co-localization between a pair of query and reference tracks. We observed that the statistical tests that did not account for the assembly gaps in the null model resulted in a distribution of the test statistic that is shifted to the right and a distribu tion of p-values that is shifted to the left (leading to inflated significance). Conclusion: Our results shows that not accounting for assembly gaps in statistical testing of co-localization analysis may lead to false positives and over-optimistic findings.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frost, H Robert</author><author>Amos, Christopher I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A multi-omics approach for identifying important pathways and genes in human cancer.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>479</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer genomics</keyword><keyword>Driver mutations</keyword><keyword>Gene set testing</keyword><keyword>Pathway analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30541428</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2476-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Frost, Amos - BMC bioinformatics - A multi-omics approach for identifying important pathways and genes in human cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2476-8</url><url>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12859-018-2476-8?utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=MKEF_USG_Researcher_inbound</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30541428</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentr</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>BACKGROUND Cancer develops when pathways controlling cell survival, cell fate or genome maintenance are disrupted by the somatic alteration of key driver genes. Understanding how pathway disruption is driven by somatic alterations is thus essential for an accurate characterization of cancer biology and identification of therapeutic targets. Unfortunately, current cancer pathway analysis methods fail to fully model the relationship between somatic alterations and pathway activity. RESULTS To address these limitations, we developed a multi-omics method for identifying biologically important pathways and genes in human cancer. Our approach combines single-sample pathway analysis with multi-stage, lasso-penalized regression to find pathways whose gene expression can be explained largely in terms of gene-level somatic alterations in the tumor. Importantly, this method can analyze case-only data sets, does not require information regarding pathway topology and supports personalized pathway analysis using just somatic alteration data for a limited number of cancer-associated genes. The practical effectiveness of this technique is illustrated through an analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas using gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database. CONCLUSIONS Novel insights into the pathophysiology of human cancer can be obtained from statistical models that predict expression-based pathway activity in terms of non-silent somatic mutations and copy number variation. These models enable the identification of biologically important pathways and genes and support personalized pathway analysis in cases where gene expression data is unavailable.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ren, Yuanfang</author><author>Ay, Ahmet</author><author>Kahveci, Tamer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Shortest path counting in probabilistic biological networks.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>465</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Community detection</keyword><keyword>Edge betweenness</keyword><keyword>Probabilistic networks</keyword><keyword>Shortest path</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1471-2105 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>30514202</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2480-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Ren, Ay, Kahveci - BMC bioinformatics - Shortest path counting in probabilistic biological networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2480-z</url><url>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12859-018-2480-z?utm_source=researcher_app&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=MKEF_USG_Researcher_inbound</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30514202</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentr</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Biological regulatory networks, representing the interactions between genes and their products, control almost every biological activity in the cell. Shortest path search is critical to apprehend the structure of these networks, and to detect their key components. Counting the number of shortest paths between pairs of genes in biological networks is a polynomial time problem. The fact that biological interactions are uncertain events however drastically complicates the problem, as it makes the topology of a given network uncertain. RESULTS In this paper, we develop a novel method to count the number of shortest paths between two nodes in probabilistic networks. Unlike earlier approaches, which uses the shortest path counting methods that are specifically designed for deterministic networks, our method builds a new mathematical model to express and compute the number of shortest paths. We prove the correctness of this model. CONCLUSIONS We compare our novel method to three existing shortest path counting methods on synthetic and real gene regulatory networks. Our experiments demonstrate that our method is scalable, and it outperforms the existing methods in accuracy. Application of our shortest path counting method to detect communities in probabilistic networks shows that our method successfully finds communities in probabilistic networks. Moreover, our experiments on cell cycle pathway among different cancer types exhibit that our method helps in uncovering key functional characteristics of biological networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iorio, Francesco</author><author>Garcia-Alonso, Luz</author><author>Brammeld, Jonathan S</author><author>Martincorena, Iňigo</author><author>Wille, David R</author><author>McDermott, Ultan</author><author>Saez-Rodriguez, Julio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pathway-based dissection of the genomic heterogeneity of cancer hallmarks' acquisition with SLAPenrich.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title></periodical><pages>6713</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>2045-2322 (Electronic) 2045-2322 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>29713020</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-018-25076-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Iorio et al. - Scientific reports - Pathway-based dissection of the genomic heterogeneity of cancer hallmarks' acquisition with S.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/scientificreports/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29713020</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5928049</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>Cancer hallmarks are evolutionary traits required by a tumour to develop. While extensively characterised, the way these traits are achieved through the accumulation of somatic mutations in key biological pathways is not fully understood. To shed light on this subject, we characterised the landscape of pathway alterations associated with somatic mutations observed in 4,415 patients across ten cancer types, using 374 orthogonal pathway gene-sets mapped onto canonical cancer hallmarks. Towards this end, we developed SLAPenrich: a computational method based on population-level statistics, freely available as an open source R package. Assembling the identified pathway alterations into sets of hallmark signatures allowed us to connect somatic mutations to clinically interpretable cancer mechanisms. Further, we explored the heterogeneity of these signatures, in terms of ratio of altered pathways associated with each individual hallmark, assuming that this is reflective of the extent of selective advantage provided to the cancer type under consideration. Our analysis revealed the predominance of certain hallmarks in specific cancer types, thus suggesting different evolutionary trajectories across cancer lineages. Finally, although many pathway alteration enrichments are guided by somatic mutations in frequently altered high-confidence cancer genes, excluding these driver mutations preserves the hallmark heterogeneity signatures, thus the detected hallmarks' predominance across cancer types. As a consequence, we propose the hallmark signatures as a ground truth to characterise tails of infrequent genomic alterations and identify potential novel cancer driver genes and networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reyna, Matthew A</author><author>Leiserson, Mark D M</author><author>Raphael, Benjamin J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hierarchical HotNet: identifying hierarchies of altered subnetworks.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>i972-i980</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30423088</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bty613</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Reyna, Leiserson, Raphael - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Hierarchical HotNet identifying hierarchies of altered subnetworks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/34/17/i972/5093236</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30423088</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6129270</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>Motivation The analysis of high-dimensional 'omics data is often informed by the use of biological interaction networks. For example, protein-protein interaction networks have been used to analyze gene expression data, to prioritize germline variants, and to identify somatic driver mutations in cancer. In these and other applications, the underlying computational problem is to identify altered subnetworks containing genes that are both highly altered in an 'omics dataset and are topologically close (e.g. connected) on an interaction network. Results We introduce Hierarchical HotNet, an algorithm that finds a hierarchy of altered subnetworks. Hierarchical HotNet assesses the statistical significance of the resulting subnetworks over a range of biological scales and explicitly controls for ascertainment bias in the network. We evaluate the performance of Hierarchical HotNet and several other algorithms that identify altered subnetworks on the problem of predicting cancer genes and significantly mutated subnetworks. On somatic mutation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Hierarchical HotNet outperforms other methods and identifies significantly mutated subnetworks containing both well-known cancer genes and candidate cancer genes that are rarely mutated in the cohort. Hierarchical HotNet is a robust algorithm for identifying altered subnetworks across different 'omics datasets. Availability and implementation http://github.com/raphael-group/hierarchical-hotnet.

Methods are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting for the enormous number of genes. We describe a method, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene on the basis of change in gene expression relative to the standard deviation of repeated measurements. For genes with scores greater than an adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance, the false discovery rate (FDR). When the transcriptional response of human cells to ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays, SAM identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold with an estimated FDR of 12%, compared with FDRs of 60 and 84% by using conventional methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell cycle regulation and 3 in apoptosis. Surprisingly, four nucleotide excision repair genes were induced, suggesting that this repair pathway for UV-damaged DNA might play a previously unrecognized role in repairing DNA damaged by ionizing radiation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ding, Chris</author><author>Li, Tao</author><author>Peng, Wei</author><author>Park, Haesun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorizations for Clustering</title></titles><periodical/><keywords><keyword>Experimentation</keyword><keyword>I2 [Artificial Intelligence]: Learning</keyword><keyword>I53 [Pattern Recogni-tion]: Clustering General Ter</keyword><keyword>Theory Keywords nonnegative matrix factorization (</keyword><keyword>clustering</keyword><keyword>multi-peak distribution</keyword><keyword>orthogonal factorization</keyword><keyword>tri-factorization</keyword></keywords><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - Ding et al. - Unknown - Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorizations for Clustering.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.75.3933&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Currently, most research on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) focus on 2-factor X = FG T factorization.

In particular, this network Lasso method allows to learn graph signals from a small number of noisy signal samples by using the total variation of a graph signal for regularization. While efficient and scalable implementations of the network Lasso are available, only little is known about the conditions on the underlying network structure which ensure network Lasso to be accurate. By leveraging concepts of compressed sensing, we address this gap and derive precise conditions on the underlying network topology and sampling set which guarantee the network Lasso for a particular loss function to deliver an accurate estimate of the entire underlying graph signal.

We model the underlying hypothesis, which relates data points to labels, as a graph signal, defined over some graph (network) structure intrinsic to the dataset. Following the key principle of supervised learning, i.e., similar inputs yield similar outputs, we require the graph signals induced by labels to have small total variation. Accordingly, we formulate the problem of learning the labels of data points as a non-smooth convex optimization problem which amounts to balancing between the empirical loss, i.e., the discrepancy with some partially available label information, and the smoothness quantified by the total variation of the learned graph signal. We solve this optimization problem by appealing to a recently proposed preconditioned variant of the popular primal-dual method by Pock and Chambolle, which results in a sparse label propagation algorithm. This learning algorithm allows for a highly scalable implementation as message passing over the underlying data graph. By applying concepts of compressed sensing to the learning problem, we are also able to provide a transparent sufficient condition on the underlying network structure such that accurate learning of the labels is possible. We also present an implementation of the message passing formulation allows for a highly scalable implementation in big data frameworks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Zhi</author><author>Dong, Xiao</author><author>Li, Yixue</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Genome-Wide Study of Allele-Specific Expression in Colorectal Cancer</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-11</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>November</issue><keywords><keyword>allele-specific expression</keyword><keyword>allele-specific expression, colorectal cancer, cis</keyword><keyword>cis -regulatory variation</keyword><keyword>colorectal cancer</keyword><keyword>somatic mutation</keyword><keyword>tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fgene.2018.00570</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Liu, Dong, Li - Frontiers in Genetics - A Genome-Wide Study of Allele-Specific Expression in Colorectal Cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2018.00570/full</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maertens, Alexandra</author><author>Tran, Vy</author><author>Kleensang, Andre</author><author>Hartung, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) Reveals Novel Transcription Factors Associated With Bisphenol A Dose-Response</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>508</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>November</issue><keywords><keyword>PADI4</keyword><keyword>SREBF1</keyword><keyword>Tfap2c</keyword><keyword>WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analyse</keyword><keyword>ZMYND8</keyword><keyword>ZNF217</keyword><keyword>bisphenol A</keyword><keyword>estrogen</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fgene.2018.00508</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Maertens et al. - Frontiers in Genetics - Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) Reveals Novel Transcription Factors.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2018.00508/abstract</url><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2018.00508/full</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Despite Bisphenol-A (BPA) being subject to extensive study, a thorough understanding of molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), which takes advantage of a graph theoretical approach to understanding correlations amongst genes and grouping genes into modules that typically have co-ordinated biological functions and regulatory mechanisms, that despite some commonality in altered genes, there is minimal overlap between BPA and estrogen in terms of network topology. We confirmed previous findings that ZNF217 and TFAP2C are involved in the estrogen pathway, and are implicated in BPA as well, although for BPA they appear to be active in the absence of canonical estrogen-receptor driven gene expression. Furthermore, our study suggested that PADI4 and RACK7/ZMYNDB8 may be involved in the overlap in gene expression between estradiol and BPA. Lastly, we demonstrated that even at low doses there are unique transcription factors that appear to be driving the biology of BPA, such as SREBF1. Overall, our data is consistent with other reports that BPA leads to subtle gene changes rather than profound aberrations of a conserved estrogen signaling (or other) pathways</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vaseva, Angelina V</author><author>Blake, Devon R</author><author>Gilbert, Thomas S K</author><author>Ng, Serina</author><author>Hostetter, Galen</author><author>Azam, Salma H.</author><author>Ozkan-Dagliyan, Irem</author><author>Gautam, Prson</author><author>Bryant, Kirsten L.</author><author>Pearce, Kenneth H.</author><author>Herring, Laura E.</author><author>Han, Haiyong</author><author>Graves, Lee M.</author><author>Witkiewicz, Agnieszka K.</author><author>Knudsen, Erik S.</author><author>Pecot, Chad V.</author><author>Rashid, Naim</author><author>Houghton, Peter J.</author><author>Wennerberg, Krister</author><author>Cox, Adrienne D</author><author>Der, Channing J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KRAS Suppression-Induced Degradation of MYC Is Antagonized by a MEK5-ERK5 Compensatory Mechanism.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>807-822.e7</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>EGFR</keyword><keyword>ERK</keyword><keyword>ERK5</keyword><keyword>FBXW7</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>MYC</keyword><keyword>PI3K</keyword><keyword>SRC</keyword><keyword>pancreatic cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30423298</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2018.10.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Vaseva et al. - Cancer cell - KRAS Suppression-Induced Degradation of MYC Is Antagonized by a MEK5-ERK5 Compensatory Mechanism.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2018.10.001</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30423298</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Our recent ERK1/2 inhibitor analyses in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) indicated ERK1/2-independent mechanisms maintaining MYC protein stability. To identify these mechanisms, we determined the signaling networks by which mutant KRAS regulates MYC. Acute KRAS suppression caused rapid proteasome-dependent loss of MYC protein, through both ERK1/2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Surprisingly, MYC degradation was independent of PI3K-AKT-GSK3β signaling and the E3 ligase FBWX7. We then established and applied a high-throughput screen for MYC protein degradation and performed a kinome-wide proteomics screen. We identified an ERK1/2-inhibition-induced feedforward mechanism dependent on EGFR and SRC, leading to ERK5 activation and phosphorylation of MYC at S62, preventing degradation. Concurrent inhibition of ERK1/2 and ERK5 disrupted this mechanism, synergistically causing loss of MYC and suppressing PDAC growth.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leiserson, Mark D M</author><author>Reyna, Matthew A</author><author>Raphael, Benjamin J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A weighted exact test for mutually exclusive mutations in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>i736-i745</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1367-4803</isbn><accession-num>27587696</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btw462</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Leiserson, Reyna, Raphael - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - A weighted exact test for mutually exclusive mutations in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/projects/wext</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27587696</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5013919</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION The somatic mutations in the pathways that drive cancer development tend to be mutually exclusive across tumors, providing a signal for distinguishing driver mutations from a larger number of random passenger mutations. This mutual exclusivity signal can be confounded by high and highly variable mutation rates across a cohort of samples. Current statistical tests for exclusivity that incorporate both per-gene and per-sample mutational frequencies are computationally expensive and have limited precision. RESULTS We formulate a weighted exact test for assessing the significance of mutual exclusivity in an arbitrary number of mutational events. Our test conditions on the number of samples with a mutation as well as per-event, per-sample mutation probabilities. We provide a recursive formula to compute P-values for the weighted test exactly as well as a highly accurate and efficient saddlepoint approximation of the test. We use our test to approximate a commonly used permutation test for exclusivity that conditions on per-event, per-sample mutation frequencies. However, our test is more efficient and it recovers more significant results than the permutation test. We use our Weighted Exclusivity Test (WExT) software to analyze hundreds of colorectal and endometrial samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, which are two cancer types that often have extremely high mutation rates. On both cancer types, the weighted test identifies sets of mutually exclusive mutations in cancer genes with fewer false positives than earlier approaches.

We propose a framework for the systematic discovery of genetic alterations that are causal determinants of disease, by prioritizing genes upstream of functional disease drivers, within regulatory networks inferred de novo from experimental data. We tested this framework by identifying the genetic determinants of the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Our analysis uncovered KLHL9 deletions as upstream activators of two previously established master regulators of the subtype, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. Rescue of KLHL9 expression induced proteasomal degradation of C/EBP proteins, abrogated the mesenchymal signature, and reduced tumor viability in vitro and in vivo. Deletions of KLHL9 were confirmed in &gt; 50% of mesenchymal cases in an independent cohort, thus representing the most frequent genetic determinant of the subtype. The method generalized to study other human diseases, including breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bian, Shuhui</author><author>Hou, Yu</author><author>Zhou, Xin</author><author>Li, Xianlong</author><author>Yong, Jun</author><author>Wang, Yicheng</author><author>Wang, Wendong</author><author>Yan, Jia</author><author>Hu, Boqiang</author><author>Guo, Hongshan</author><author>Wang, Jilian</author><author>Gao, Shuai</author><author>Mao, Yunuo</author><author>Dong, Ji</author><author>Zhu, Ping</author><author>Xiu, Dianrong</author><author>Yan, Liying</author><author>Wen, Lu</author><author>Qiao, Jie</author><author>Tang, Fuchou</author><author>Fu, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell multiomics sequencing and analyses of human colorectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>1060-1063</pages><volume>362</volume><issue>6418</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30498128</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.aao3791</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Bian et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Single-cell multiomics sequencing and analyses of human colorectal cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/</url><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6418/1060/tab-pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30498128</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Although genomic instability, epigenetic abnormality, and gene expression dysregulation are hallmarks of colorectal cancer, these features have not been simultaneously analyzed at single-cell resolution. Using optimized single-cell multiomics sequencing together with multiregional sampling of the primary tumor and lymphatic and distant metastases, we developed insights beyond intratumoral heterogeneity. Genome-wide DNA methylation levels were relatively consistent within a single genetic sublineage. The genome-wide DNA demethylation patterns of cancer cells were consistent in all 10 patients whose DNA we sequenced. The cancer cells' DNA demethylation degrees clearly correlated with the densities of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3 of normal tissue and those of repetitive element long interspersed nuclear element 1. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of reconstructing genetic lineages and tracing their epigenomic and transcriptomic dynamics with single-cell multiomics sequencing.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parsons, Barbara L.</author><author>McKim, Karen L.</author><author>Myers, Meagan B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variation in organ-specific PIK3CA and KRAS mutant levels in normal human tissues correlates with mutation prevalence in corresponding carcinomas.</title><secondary-title>Environmental and molecular mutagenesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental and molecular mutagenesis</full-title></periodical><pages>466-476</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>biomarker</keyword><keyword>cancer susceptibility</keyword><keyword>clonal selection</keyword><keyword>personalized medicine</keyword><keyword>tumor heterogeneity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>1016201303</isbn><accession-num>28755461</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/em.22110</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Parsons, McKim, Myers - Environmental and molecular mutagenesis - Variation in organ-specific PIK3CA and KRAS mutant levels in no.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28755461</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5601221</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Large-scale sequencing efforts have described the mutational complexity of individual cancers and identified mutations prevalent in different cancers. As a complementary approach, allele-specific competitive blocker PCR (ACB-PCR) is being used to quantify levels of hotspot cancer driver mutations (CDMs) with high sensitivity, to elucidate the tissue-specific properties of CDMs, their occurrence as tumor cell subpopulations, and their occurrence in normal tissues. Here we report measurements of PIK3CA H1047R mutant fraction (MF) in normal colonic mucosa, normal lung, colonic adenomas, colonic adenocarcinomas, and lung adenocarcinomas. We report PIK3CA E545K MF measurements in those tissues, as well as in normal breast, normal thyroid, mammary ductal carcinomas, and papillary thyroid carcinomas. We report KRAS G12D and G12V MF measurements in normal colon. These MF measurements were integrated with previously published ACB-PCR data on KRAS G12D, KRAS G12V, and PIK3CA H1047R. Analysis of these data revealed a correlation between the degree of interindividual variability in these mutations (as log10 MF standard deviation) in normal tissues and the frequencies with which the mutations are detected in carcinomas of the corresponding organs in the COSMIC database. This novel observation has important implications. It suggests that interindividual variability in mutation levels of normal tissues may be used as a metric to identify mutations with critical early roles in tissue-specific carcinogenesis. Additionally, it raises the possibility that personalized cancer therapeutics, developed to target specifically activated oncogenic products, might be repurposed as prophylactic therapies to reduce the accumulation of cells carrying CDMs and, thereby, reduce future cancer risk.

However, pathway scores can also be used as predictive features in machine learning. That requires, firstly, increasing statistical power and biological relevance via a network enrichment analysis (NEA) and, secondly, a fast and convenient procedure for rendering the original data into a space of pathway scores. However, previous implementations of NEA involved multiple runs of network randomization and were therefore slow. RESULTS Here, we present a new R package NEArender which can transform raw 'omics' features of experimental or clinical samples into matrices describing the same samples with many fewer NEA-based pathway scores. This is done via a parametric estimation of the null binomial distribution and is thus much faster and less biased than randomization procedures. Further, we compare estimates from these two alternative procedures and demonstrate that the summarization of individual genes to pathways increases the statistical power compared to both the default differential expression analysis on individual genes and the state-of-the-art gene set enrichment analysis. The package also contains functions for preparing input, modeling null distributions, and evaluating alternative versions of the global network. CONCLUSIONS Beyond the state-of-the-art exploration of molecular data through pathway enrichment, score matrices produced by NEArender can be used in larger bioinformatics pipelines as input for phenotype modeling, predicting disease outcomes etc. This approach is often more sensitive and robust than using the original data. The package NEArender is complementary to the online NEA tool EviNet ( https://www.evinet.org ) and, unlike of the latter, enables high performance of computations off-line. The R package NEArender version 1.4 is available at CRAN repository https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NEArender/.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Yoo-Ah</author><author>Cho, Dong-Yeon</author><author>Dao, Phuong</author><author>Przytycka, Teresa M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MEMCover: integrated analysis of mutual exclusivity and functional network reveals dysregulated pathways across multiple cancer types.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>i284-92</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26072494</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btv247</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Kim et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - MEMCover integrated analysis of mutual exclusivity and functional network reveals.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.functionalnet.org/humannet/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26072494</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4481701</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION The data gathered by the Pan-Cancer initiative has created an unprecedented opportunity for illuminating common features across different cancer types. However, separating tissue-specific features from across cancer signatures has proven to be challenging. One of the often-observed properties of the mutational landscape of cancer is the mutual exclusivity of cancer driving mutations. Even though studies based on individual cancer types suggested that mutually exclusive pairs often share the same functional pathway, the relationship between across cancer mutual exclusivity and functional connectivity has not been previously investigated. RESULTS We introduce a classification of mutual exclusivity into three basic classes: within tissue type exclusivity, across tissue type exclusivity and between tissue type exclusivity. We then combined across-cancer mutual exclusivity with interactions data to uncover pan-cancer dysregulated pathways. Our new method, Mutual Exclusivity Module Cover (MEMCover) not only identified previously known Pan-Cancer dysregulated subnetworks but also novel subnetworks whose across cancer role has not been appreciated well before. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of mutual exclusivity hubs, putatively corresponding to cancer drivers with strong growth advantages. Finally, we show that while mutually exclusive pairs within or across cancer types are predominantly functionally interacting, the pairs in between cancer mutual exclusivity class are more often disconnected in functional networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knight, V Bleu</author><author>Serrano, Elba E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Expression analysis of RNA sequencing data from human neural and glial cell lines depends on technical replication and normalization methods</title><secondary-title>BMC Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><volume>19</volume><keywords><keyword>Experimental design</keyword><keyword>Glia</keyword><keyword>Human astrocytes</keyword><keyword>Human neural stem cells</keyword><keyword>Next generation sequencing</keyword><keyword>Normalization</keyword><keyword>Principal variance component analysis</keyword><keyword>RNA Seq</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2382-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Knight, Serrano - BMC Bioinformatics - Expression analysis of RNA sequencing data from human neural and glial cell lines depends.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2382-0</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The potential for astrocyte participation in central nervous system recovery is highlighted by in vitro experiments demonstrating their capacity to transdifferentiate into neurons. Understanding astrocyte plasticity could be advanced by comparing astrocytes with stem cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is ideal for comparing differences across cell types. However, this novel multi-stage process has the potential to introduce unwanted technical variation at several points in the experimental workflow. Quantitative understanding of the contribution of experimental parameters to technical variation would facilitate the design of robust RNA-Seq experiments. RNA-Seq was used to achieve biological and technical objectives. The biological aspect compared gene expression between normal human fetal-derived astrocytes and human neural stem cells cultured in identical conditions. When differential expression threshold criteria of |log2 fold change| &gt; 2 were applied to the data, no significant differences were observed. The technical component quantified variation arising from particular steps in the research pathway, and compared the ability of different normalization methods to reduce unwanted variance. To facilitate this objective, a liberal false discovery rate of 10% and a |log2 fold change| &gt; 0.5 were implemented for the differential expression threshold. Data were normalized with RPKM, TMM, and UQS methods using JMP Genomics. The contributions of key replicable experimental parameters (cell lot; library preparation; flow cell) to variance in the data were evaluated using principal variance component analysis. Our analysis showed that, although the variance for every parameter is strongly influenced by the normalization method, the largest contributor to technical variance was library preparation. The ability to detect differentially expressed genes was also affected by normalization; differences were only detected in non-normalized and TMM-normalized data. The similarity in gene expression between astrocytes and neural stem cells supports the potential for astrocytic transdifferentiation into neurons, and emphasizes the need to evaluate the therapeutic potential of astrocytes for central nervous system damage. The choice of normalization method influences the contributions to experimental variance as well as the outcomes of differential expression analysis. However irrespective of normalization method, our findings illustrate that library preparation contributed the largest component of technical variance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashtiani, Minoo</author><author>Salehzadeh-Yazdi, Ali</author><author>Razaghi-Moghadam, Zahra</author><author>Hennig, Holger</author><author>Wolkenhauer, Olaf</author><author>Mirzaie, Mehdi</author><author>Jafari, Mohieddin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A systematic survey of centrality measures for protein-protein interaction networks.</title><secondary-title>BMC systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>80</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Centrality analysis</keyword><keyword>Clustering</keyword><keyword>Network science</keyword><keyword>Principal components analysis (PCA)</keyword><keyword>Protein-protein interaction network (PPIN)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>17520509 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>30064421</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12918-018-0598-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Ashtiani et al. - BMC systems biology - A systematic survey of centrality measures for protein-protein interaction networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12918-018-0598-2</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30064421</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6069823</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Numerous centrality measures have been introduced to identify &quot;central&quot; nodes in large networks. The availability of a wide range of measures for ranking influential nodes leaves the user to decide which measure may best suit the analysis of a given network. The choice of a suitable measure is furthermore complicated by the impact of the network topology on ranking influential nodes by centrality measures. To approach this problem systematically, we examined the centrality profile of nodes of yeast protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) in order to detect which centrality measure is succeeding in predicting influential proteins. We studied how different topological network features are reflected in a large set of commonly used centrality measures. RESULTS We used yeast PPINs to compare 27 common of centrality measures. The measures characterize and assort influential nodes of the networks. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering and found that the most informative measures depend on the network's topology. Interestingly, some measures had a high level of contribution in comparison to others in all PPINs, namely Latora closeness, Decay, Lin, Freeman closeness, Diffusion, Residual closeness and Average distance centralities. CONCLUSIONS The choice of a suitable set of centrality measures is crucial for inferring important functional properties of a network. We concluded that undertaking data reduction using unsupervised machine learning methods helps to choose appropriate variables (centrality measures). Hence, we proposed identifying the contribution proportions of the centrality measures with PCA as a prerequisite step of network analysis before inferring functional consequences, e.g., essentiality of a node.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horn, Heiko</author><author>Lawrence, Michael S</author><author>Chouinard, Candace R</author><author>Shrestha, Yashaswi</author><author>Hu, Jessica Xin</author><author>Worstell, Elizabeth</author><author>Shea, Emily</author><author>Ilic, Nina</author><author>Kim, Eejung</author><author>Kamburov, Atanas</author><author>Kashani, Alireza</author><author>Hahn, William C</author><author>Campbell, Joshua D</author><author>Boehm, Jesse S</author><author>Getz, Gad</author><author>Lage, Kasper</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NetSig: network-based discovery from cancer genomes.</title><secondary-title>Nature methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature methods</full-title></periodical><pages>61-66</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1548-7105</isbn><accession-num>29200198</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nmeth.4514</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Horn et al. - Nature methods - NetSig network-based discovery from cancer genomes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.lagelab.org/resources/.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29200198</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5985961</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Methods that integrate molecular network information and tumor genome data could complement gene-based statistical tests to identify likely new cancer genes; but such approaches are challenging to validate at scale, and their predictive value remains unclear. We developed a robust statistic (NetSig) that integrates protein interaction networks with data from 4,742 tumor exomes. NetSig can accurately classify known driver genes in 60% of tested tumor types and predicts 62 new driver candidates. Using a quantitative experimental framework to determine in vivo tumorigenic potential in mice, we found that NetSig candidates induce tumors at rates that are comparable to those of known oncogenes and are ten-fold higher than those of random genes. By reanalyzing nine tumor-inducing NetSig candidates in 242 patients with oncogene-negative lung adenocarcinomas, we find that two (AKT2 and TFDP2) are significantly amplified.

Current approaches are primarily based on mutation frequencies of single-genes, which lack the power to detect infrequently mutated driver genes and ignore functional interconnection and regulation among cancer genes. We propose a novel mutation network method, VarWalker, to prioritize driver genes in large scale cancer mutation data. VarWalker fits generalized additive models for each sample based on sample-specific mutation profiles and builds on the joint frequency of both mutation genes and their close interactors. These interactors are selected and optimized using the Random Walk with Restart algorithm in a protein-protein interaction network. We applied the method in &gt;300 tumor genomes in two large-scale NGS benchmark datasets: 183 lung adenocarcinoma samples and 121 melanoma samples. In each cancer, we derived a consensus mutation subnetwork containing significantly enriched consensus cancer genes and cancer-related functional pathways. These cancer-specific mutation networks were then validated using independent datasets for each cancer. Importantly, VarWalker prioritizes well-known, infrequently mutated genes, which are shown to interact with highly recurrently mutated genes yet have been ignored by conventional single-gene-based approaches. Utilizing VarWalker, we demonstrated that network-assisted approaches can be effectively adapted to facilitate the detection of cancer driver genes in NGS data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wong, Aaron K</author><author>Krishnan, Arjun</author><author>Troyanskaya, Olga G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GIANT 2.0: genome-scale integrated analysis of gene networks in tissues.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>W65-W70</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>W1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>13624962 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>29800226</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gky408</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Wong, Krishnan, Troyanskaya - Nucleic acids research - GIANT 2.0 genome-scale integrated analysis of gene networks in tissues.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1101/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10357139</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29800226</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6030827</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>GIANT2 (Genome-wide Integrated Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues) is an interactive web server that enables biomedical researchers to analyze their proteins and pathways of interest and generate hypotheses in the context of genome-scale functional maps of human tissues. The precise actions of genes are frequently dependent on their tissue context, yet direct assay of tissue-specific protein function and interactions remains infeasible in many normal human tissues and cell-types. With GIANT2, researchers can explore predicted tissue-specific functional roles of genes and reveal changes in those roles across tissues, all through interactive multi-network visualizations and analyses. Additionally, the NetWAS approach available through the server uses tissue-specific/cell-type networks predicted by GIANT2 to re-prioritize statistical associations from GWAS studies and identify disease-associated genes. GIANT2 predicts tissue-specific interactions by integrating diverse functional genomics data from now over 61 400 experiments for 283 diverse tissues and cell-types. GIANT2 does not require any registration or installation and is freely available for use at http://giant-v2.princeton.edu.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Young, Lucy C</author><author>Hartig, Nicole</author><author>Boned Del Río, Isabel</author><author>Sari, Sibel</author><author>Ringham-Terry, Benjamin</author><author>Wainwright, Joshua R</author><author>Jones, Greg G</author><author>McCormick, Frank</author><author>Rodriguez-Viciana, Pablo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SHOC2-MRAS-PP1 complex positively regulates RAF activity and contributes to Noonan syndrome pathogenesis.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>E10576-E10585</pages><volume>115</volume><issue>45</issue><keywords><keyword>MRAS</keyword><keyword>Noonan syndrome</keyword><keyword>PP1</keyword><keyword>RAS</keyword><keyword>SHOC2</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30348783</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1720352115</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Young et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - SHOC2-MRAS-PP1 complex positivel.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1720352115</url><url>http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1720352115</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30348783</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Dephosphorylation of the inhibitory &quot;S259&quot; site on RAF kinases (S259 on CRAF, S365 on BRAF) plays a key role in RAF activation. The MRAS GTPase, a close relative of RAS oncoproteins, interacts with SHOC2 and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to form a heterotrimeric holoenzyme that dephosphorylates this S259 RAF site. MRAS and SHOC2 function as PP1 regulatory subunits providing the complex with striking specificity against RAF. MRAS also functions as a targeting subunit as membrane localization is required for efficient RAF dephosphorylation and ERK pathway regulation in cells. SHOC2's predicted structure shows remarkable similarities to the A subunit of PP2A, suggesting a case of convergent structural evolution with the PP2A heterotrimer. We have identified multiple regions in SHOC2 involved in complex formation as well as residues in MRAS switch I and the interswitch region that help account for MRAS's unique effector specificity for SHOC2-PP1. MRAS, SHOC2, and PPP1CB are mutated in Noonan syndrome, and we show that syndromic mutations invariably promote complex formation with each other, but not necessarily with other interactors. Thus, Noonan syndrome in individuals with SHOC2, MRAS, or PPPC1B mutations is likely driven at the biochemical level by enhanced ternary complex formation and highlights the crucial role of this phosphatase holoenzyme in RAF S259 dephosphorylation, ERK pathway dynamics, and normal human development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sondka, Zbyslaw</author><author>Bamford, Sally</author><author>Cole, Charlotte G.</author><author>Ward, Sari A.</author><author>Dunham, Ian</author><author>Forbes, Simon A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The COSMIC Cancer Gene Census: describing genetic dysfunction across all human cancers.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

After a major expansion and complete re-evaluation, the 2018 CGC describes in detail the effect of 719 cancer-driving genes. The recent expansion includes functional and mechanistic descriptions of how each gene contributes to disease generation in terms of the key cancer hallmarks and the impact of mutations on gene and protein function. These functional characteristics depict the extraordinary complexity of cancer biology and suggest multiple cancer-related functions for many genes, which are often highly tissue-dependent or tumour stage-dependent. The 2018 CGC encompasses a second tier, describing an expanding list of genes (currently 145) from more recent cancer studies that show supportive but less detailed indications of a role in cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tabula Muris Consortium</author><author>Overall coordination</author><author>Logistical coordination</author><author>Organ collection and processing</author><author>Library preparation and sequencing</author><author>Computational data analysis</author><author>Cell type annotation</author><author>Writing group</author><author>Supplemental text writing group</author><author>Principal investigators</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a Tabula Muris.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>367-372</pages><volume>562</volume><issue>7727</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30283141</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41586-018-0590-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Tabula Muris Consortium et al. - Nature - Single-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a Tabula Muris.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0590-4</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0590-4</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283141</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Here we present a compendium of single-cell transcriptomic data from the model organism Mus musculus that comprises more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. These data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and enable the direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types that are shared between tissues, such as T lymphocytes and endothelial cells from different anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3'-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, whereas the other, full-length transcript analysis based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enabled the characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huttlin, Edward L</author><author>Jedrychowski, Mark P</author><author>Elias, Joshua E</author><author>Goswami, Tapasree</author><author>Rad, Ramin</author><author>Beausoleil, Sean A</author><author>Villén, Judit</author><author>Haas, Wilhelm</author><author>Sowa, Mathew E</author><author>Gygi, Steven P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A tissue-specific atlas of mouse protein phosphorylation and expression.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>1174-89</pages><volume>143</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>0092-8674</isbn><accession-num>21183079</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2010.12.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Huttlin et al. - Cell - A tissue-specific atlas of mouse protein phosphorylation and expression.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://gygi.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21183079</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3035969</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Although most tissues in an organism are genetically identical, the biochemistry of each is optimized to fulfill its unique physiological roles, with important consequences for human health and disease. Each tissue's unique physiology requires tightly regulated gene and protein expression coordinated by specialized, phosphorylation-dependent intracellular signaling. To better understand the role of phosphorylation in maintenance of physiological differences among tissues, we performed proteomic and phosphoproteomic characterizations of nine mouse tissues. We identified 12,039 proteins, including 6296 phosphoproteins harboring nearly 36,000 phosphorylation sites. Comparing protein abundances and phosphorylation levels revealed specialized, interconnected phosphorylation networks within each tissue while suggesting that many proteins are regulated by phosphorylation independently of their expression. Our data suggest that the &quot;typical&quot; phosphoprotein is widely expressed yet displays variable, often tissue-specific phosphorylation that tunes protein activity to the specific needs of each tissue. We offer this dataset as an online resource for the biological research community.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stites, Edward C</author><author>Trampont, Paul C</author><author>Ma, Zhong</author><author>Ravichandran, Kodi S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Network analysis of oncogenic Ras activation in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>463-7</pages><volume>318</volume><issue>5849</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>1095-9203 (Electronic)\r0036-8075 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>17947584</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1144642</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Stites et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Network analysis of oncogenic Ras activation in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5849/459/DC1</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17947583</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17947584</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>To investigate the unregulated Ras activation associated with cancer, we developed and validated a mathematical model of Ras signaling. The model-based predictions and associated experiments help explain why only one of two classes of activating Ras point mutations with in vitro transformation potential is commonly found in cancers. Model-based analysis of these mutants uncovered a systems-level process that contributes to total Ras activation in cells. This predicted behavior was supported by experimental observations. We also used the model to identify a strategy in which a drug could cause stronger inhibition on the cancerous Ras network than on the wild-type network. This system-level analysis of the oncogenic Ras network provides new insights and potential therapeutic strategies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mina, Marco</author><author>Raynaud, Franck</author><author>Tavernari, Daniele</author><author>Battistello, Elena</author><author>Sungalee, Stephanie</author><author>Saghafinia, Sadegh</author><author>Laessle, Titouan</author><author>Sanchez-Vega, Francisco</author><author>Schultz, Nikolaus</author><author>Oricchio, Elisa</author><author>Ciriello, Giovanni</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conditional Selection of Genomic Alterations Dictates Cancer Evolution and Oncogenic Dependencies.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>155-168.e6</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>cancer evolution</keyword><keyword>conditional selection</keyword><keyword>interdependent therapeutic response</keyword><keyword>oncogenic dependencies</keyword><keyword>selected events</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><isbn>1878-3686 (Electronic) 1535-6108 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>28756993</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2017.06.010</electronic-resource-num><notes>Introduces SELEC</notes><research-notes>Introduces SELEC</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Mina et al. - Cancer cell - Conditional Selection of Genomic Alterations Dictates Cancer Evolution and Oncogenic Dependencies.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2017.06.010</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756993</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancer evolves through the emergence and selection of molecular alterations. Cancer genome profiling has revealed that specific events are more or less likely to be co-selected, suggesting that the selection of one event depends on the others. However, the nature of these evolutionary dependencies and their impact remain unclear. Here, we designed SELECT, an algorithmic approach to systematically identify evolutionary dependencies from alteration patterns. By analyzing 6,456 genomes from multiple tumor types, we constructed a map of oncogenic dependencies associated with cellular pathways, transcriptional readouts, and therapeutic response. Finally, modeling of cancer evolution shows that alteration dependencies emerge only under conditional selection. These results provide a framework for the design of strategies to predict cancer progression and therapeutic response.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Way, Gregory P.</author><author>Sanchez-Vega, Francisco</author><author>La, Konnor</author><author>Armenia, Joshua</author><author>Chatila, Walid K.</author><author>Luna, Augustin</author><author>Sander, Chris</author><author>Cherniack, Andrew D.</author><author>Mina, Marco</author><author>Ciriello, Giovanni</author><author>Schultz, Nikolaus</author><author>Caesar-Johnson, Samantha J.</author><author>Demchok, John A.</author><author>Felau, Ina</author><author>Kasapi, Melpomeni</author><author>Ferguson, Martin L.</author><author>Hutter, Carolyn M.</author><author>Sofia, Heidi J.</author><author>Tarnuzzer, Roy</author><author>Wang, Zhining</author><author>Yang, Liming</author><author>Zenklusen, Jean C.</author><author>Zhang, Jiashan (Julia)</author><author>Chudamani, Sudha</author><author>Liu, Jia</author><author>Lolla, Laxmi</author><author>Naresh, Rashi</author><author>Pihl, Todd</author><author>Sun, Qiang</author><author>Wan, Yunhu</author><author>Wu, Ye</author><author>Cho, Juok</author><author>DeFreitas, Timothy</author><author>Frazer, Scott</author><author>Gehlenborg, Nils</author><author>Getz, Gad</author><author>Heiman, David I.</author><author>Kim, Jaegil</author><author>Lawrence, Michael S.</author><author>Lin, Pei</author><author>Meier, Sam</author><author>Noble, Michael S.</author><author>Saksena, Gordon</author><author>Voet, Doug</author><author>Zhang, Hailei</author><author>Bernard, Brady</author><author>Chambwe, Nyasha</author><author>Dhankani, Varsha</author><author>Knijnenburg, Theo</author><author>Kramer, Roger</author><author>Leinonen, Kalle</author><author>Liu, Yuexin</author><author>Miller, Michael</author><author>Reynolds, Sheila</author><author>Shmulevich, Ilya</author><author>Thorsson, Vesteinn</author><author>Zhang, Wei</author><author>Akbani, Rehan</author><author>Broom, Bradley M.</author><author>Hegde, Apurva M.</author><author>Ju, Zhenlin</author><author>Kanchi, Rupa S.</author><author>Korkut, Anil</author><author>Li, Jun</author><author>Liang, Han</author><author>Ling, Shiyun</author><author>Liu, Wenbin</author><author>Lu, Yiling</author><author>Mills, Gordon B.</author><author>Ng, Kwok Shing</author><author>Rao, Arvind</author><author>Ryan, Michael</author><author>Wang, Jing</author><author>Weinstein, John N.</author><author>Zhang, Jiexin</author><author>Abeshouse, Adam</author><author>Armenia, Joshua</author><author>Chakravarty, Debyani</author><author>Chatila, Walid K.</author><author>de Bruijn, Ino</author><author>Gao, Jianjiong</author><author>Gross, Benjamin E.</author><author>Heins, Zachary J.</author><author>Kundra, Ritika</author><author>La, Konnor</author><author>Ladanyi, Marc</author><author>Luna, Augustin</author><author>Nissan, Moriah G.</author><author>Ochoa, Angelica</author><author>Phillips, Sarah M.</author><author>Reznik, Ed</author><author>Sanchez-Vega, Francisco</author><author>Sander, Chris</author><author>Schultz, Nikolaus</author><author>Sheridan, Robert</author><author>Sumer, S.

The transcriptome of these “hidden responders” may reveal responsive molecular states. We describe and evaluate a machine-learning approach to classify aberrant pathway activity in tumors, which may aid in hidden responder identification. The algorithm integrates RNA-seq, copy number, and mutations from 33 different cancer types across The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PanCanAtlas project to predict aberrant molecular states in tumors. Applied to the Ras pathway, the method detects Ras activation across cancer types and identifies phenocopying variants. The model, trained on human tumors, can predict response to MEK inhibitors in wild-type Ras cell lines. We also present data that suggest that multiple hits in the Ras pathway confer increased Ras activity. The transcriptome is underused in precision oncology and, combined with machine learning, can aid in the identification of hidden responders. Way et al. develop a machine-learning approach using PanCanAtlas data to detect Ras activation in cancer. Integrating mutation, copy number, and expression data, the authors show that their method detects Ras-activating variants in tumors and sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in cell lines.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yen, Ivana</author><author>Shanahan, Frances</author><author>Merchant, Mark</author><author>Orr, Christine</author><author>Hunsaker, Thomas</author><author>Durk, Matthew</author><author>La, Hank</author><author>Zhang, Xiaolin</author><author>Martin, Scott E.</author><author>Lin, Eva</author><author>Chan, John</author><author>Yu, Yihong</author><author>Amin, Dhara</author><author>Neve, Richard M.</author><author>Gustafson, Amy</author><author>Venkatanarayan, Avinashnarayan</author><author>Foster, Scott A.</author><author>Rudolph, Joachim</author><author>Klijn, Christiaan</author><author>Malek, Shiva</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pharmacological Induction of RAS-GTP Confers RAF Inhibitor Sensitivity in KRAS Mutant Tumors.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>611-625.e7</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>BRAF</keyword><keyword>CRAF</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>MAPK</keyword><keyword>MEK inhibitors</keyword><keyword>PI3K inhibitors</keyword><keyword>RAF inhibitors</keyword><keyword>RAS-GTP</keyword><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>combination treatment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30300582</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2018.09.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Yen et al. - Cancer cell - Pharmacological Induction of RAS-GTP Confers RAF Inhibitor Sensitivity in KRAS Mutant Tumors.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2018.09.002</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30300582</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Targeting KRAS mutant tumors through inhibition of individual downstream pathways has had limited clinical success. Here we report that RAF inhibitors exhibit little efficacy in KRAS mutant tumors. In combination drug screens, MEK and PI3K inhibitors synergized with pan-RAF inhibitors through an RAS-GTP-dependent mechanism. Broad cell line profiling with RAF/MEK inhibitor combinations revealed synergistic efficacy in KRAS mutant and wild-type tumors, with KRASG13D mutants exhibiting greater synergy versus KRASG12 mutant tumors. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that MEK inhibition induced RAS-GTP levels, RAF dimerization and RAF kinase activity resulting in MEK phosphorylation in synergistic tumor lines regardless of KRAS status. Taken together, our studies uncover a strategy to rewire KRAS mutant tumors to confer sensitivity to RAF kinase inhibition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yuan, Jiao</author><author>Hu, Zhongyi</author><author>Mahal, Brandon A</author><author>Zhao, Sihai D.</author><author>Kensler, Kevin H.</author><author>Pi, Jingjiang</author><author>Hu, Xiaowen</author><author>Zhang, Youyou</author><author>Wang, Yueying</author><author>Jiang, Junjie</author><author>Li, Chunsheng</author><author>Zhong, Xiaomin</author><author>Montone, Kathleen T.</author><author>Guan, Guoqiang</author><author>Tanyi, Janos L.</author><author>Fan, Yi</author><author>Xu, Xiaowei</author><author>Morgan, Mark A.</author><author>Long, Meixiao</author><author>Zhang, Yuzhen</author><author>Zhang, Rugang</author><author>Sood, Anil K.</author><author>Rebbeck, Timothy R</author><author>Dang, Chi V</author><author>Zhang, Lin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrated Analysis of Genetic Ancestry and Genomic Alterations across Cancers.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>549-560.e9</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>cancer disparities</keyword><keyword>cancer genetics</keyword><keyword>cancer genomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30300578</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2018.08.019</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Yuan et al. - Cancer cell - Integrated Analysis of Genetic Ancestry and Genomic Alterations across Cancers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2018.08.019</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30300578</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Disparities in cancer care have been a long-standing challenge.

However, current experimental techniques for detection of lncRNA-protein interactions are limited and inefficient. Many methods have been proposed to predict protein-lncRNA interactions, but few studies make use of the topological information of heterogenous biological networks associated with the lncRNAs. In this work, we propose a novel approach, PLIPCOM, using two groups of network features to detect protein-lncRNA interactions. In particular, diffusion features and HeteSim features are extracted from protein-lncRNA heterogenous network, and then combined to build the prediction model using the Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB) algorithm. Our study highlights that the topological features of the heterogeneous network are crucial for predicting protein-lncRNA interactions. The cross-validation experiments on the benchmark dataset show that PLIPCOM method substantially outperformed previous state-of-the-art approaches in predicting protein-lncRNA interactions. We also prove the robustness of the proposed method on three unbalanced data sets. Moreover, our case studies demonstrate that our method is effective and reliable in predicting the interactions between lncRNAs and proteins.

However, these data sets might have very different characteristics. For interpretable results, data-specific variation needs to be quantified. For this task, Two-way Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (O2PLS) has been proposed. To facilitate application and development of the methodology, free and open-source software is required. However, this is not the case with O2PLS. Results We introduce OmicsPLS, an open-source implementation of the O2PLS method in R. It can handle both low- and high-dimensional datasets efficiently. Generic methods for inspecting and visualizing results are implemented. Both a standard and faster alternative cross-validation methods are available to determine the number of components. A simulation study shows good performance of OmicsPLS compared to alternatives, in terms of accuracy and CPU runtime. We demonstrate OmicsPLS by integrating genetic and glycomic data. Conclusions We propose the OmicsPLS R package: a free and open-source implementation of O2PLS for statistical data integration. OmicsPLS is available at https://cran.r-project.org/package=OmicsPLS and can be installed in R via install.packages(“OmicsPLS”).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bonnici, Vincenzo</author><author>Busato, Federico</author><author>Aldegheri, Stefano</author><author>Akhmedov, Murodzhon</author><author>Cascione, Luciano</author><author>Carmena, Alberto Arribas</author><author>Bertoni, Francesco</author><author>Bombieri, Nicola</author><author>Kwee, Ivo</author><author>Giugno, Rosalba</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>cuRnet: an R package for graph traversing on GPU</title><secondary-title>BMC Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>221-230</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>S10</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Computational Biology/Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Computer Appl. in Life Sciences</keyword><keyword>Microarrays</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2310-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Bonnici et al. - BMC Bioinformatics - cuRnet an R package for graph traversing on GPU.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2310-3</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>R has become the de-facto reference analysis environment in Bioinformatics. Plenty of tools are available as packages that extend the R functionality, and many of them target the analysis of biological networks. Several algorithms for graphs, which are the most adopted mathematical representation of networks, are well-known examples of applications that require high-performance computing, and for which classic sequential implementations are becoming inappropriate. In this context, parallel approaches targeting GPU architectures are becoming pervasive to deal with the execution time constraints. Although R packages for parallel execution on GPUs are already available, none of them provides graph algorithms. This work presents cuRnet, a R package that provides a parallel implementation for GPUs of the breath-first search (BFS), the single-source shortest paths (SSSP), and the strongly connected components (SCC) algorithms. The package allows offloading computing intensive applications to GPU devices for massively parallel computation and to speed up the runtime up to one order of magnitude with respect to the standard sequential computations on CPU. We have tested cuRnet on a benchmark of large protein interaction networks and for the interpretation of high-throughput omics data thought network analysis. cuRnet is a R package to speed up graph traversal and analysis through parallel computation on GPUs. We show the efficiency of cuRnet applied both to biological network analysis, which requires basic graph algorithms, and to complex existing procedures built upon such algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanchez-Vega, Francisco</author><author>Mina, Marco</author><author>Armenia, Joshua</author><author>Chatila, Walid K</author><author>Luna, Augustin</author><author>La, Konnor C</author><author>Dimitriadoy, Sofia</author><author>Liu, David L</author><author>Kantheti, Havish S</author><author>Saghafinia, Sadegh</author><author>Chakravarty, Debyani</author><author>Daian, Foysal</author><author>Gao, Qingsong</author><author>Bailey, Matthew H</author><author>Liang, Wen-Wei</author><author>Foltz, Steven M</author><author>Shmulevich, Ilya</author><author>Ding, Li</author><author>Heins, Zachary</author><author>Ochoa, Angelica</author><author>Gross, Benjamin</author><author>Gao, Jianjiong</author><author>Zhang, Hongxin</author><author>Kundra, Ritika</author><author>Kandoth, Cyriac</author><author>Bahceci, Istemi</author><author>Dervishi, Leonard</author><author>Dogrusoz, Ugur</author><author>Zhou, Wanding</author><author>Shen, Hui</author><author>Laird, Peter W</author><author>Way, Gregory P</author><author>Greene, Casey S</author><author>Liang, Han</author><author>Xiao, Yonghong</author><author>Wang, Chen</author><author>Iavarone, Antonio</author><author>Berger, Alice H</author><author>Bivona, Trever G</author><author>Lazar, Alexander J</author><author>Hammer, Gary D</author><author>Giordano, Thomas</author><author>Kwong, Lawrence N</author><author>McArthur, Grant</author><author>Huang, Chenfei</author><author>Tward, Aaron D.</author><author>Frederick, Mitchell J.</author><author>McCormick, Frank</author><author>Meyerson, Matthew</author><author>Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network</author><author>Van Allen, Eliezer M.</author><author>Cherniack, Andrew D.</author><author>Ciriello, Giovanni</author><author>Sander, Chris</author><author>Schultz, Nikolaus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in The Cancer Genome Atlas.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>321-337.e10</pages><volume>173</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>PanCanAtlas</keyword><keyword>TCGA</keyword><keyword>cancer genome atlas</keyword><keyword>cancer genomics</keyword><keyword>combination therapy</keyword><keyword>pan-cancer</keyword><keyword>precision oncology</keyword><keyword>signaling pathways</keyword><keyword>therapeutics</keyword><keyword>whole exome sequencing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>22111247 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>29625050</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.035</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Sanchez-Vega et al. - Cell - Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in The Cancer Genome Atlas.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.035</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29625050</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6070353</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Genetic alterations in signaling pathways that control cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and cell growth are common hallmarks of cancer, but the extent, mechanisms, and co-occurrence of alterations in these pathways differ between individual tumors and tumor types. Using mutations, copy-number changes, mRNA expression, gene fusions and DNA methylation in 9,125 tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we analyzed the mechanisms and patterns of somatic alterations in ten canonical pathways: cell cycle, Hippo, Myc, Notch, Nrf2, PI-3-Kinase/Akt, RTK-RAS, TGFβ signaling, p53 and β-catenin/Wnt. We charted the detailed landscape of pathway alterations in 33 cancer types, stratified into 64 subtypes, and identified patterns of co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity. Eighty-nine percent of tumors had at least one driver alteration in these pathways, and 57% percent of tumors had at least one alteration potentially targetable by currently available drugs. Thirty percent of tumors had multiple targetable alterations, indicating opportunities for combination therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Regev, Aviv</author><author>Teichmann, Sarah A.</author><author>Lander, Eric S.</author><author>Amit, Ido</author><author>Benoist, Christophe</author><author>Birney, Ewan</author><author>Bodenmiller, Bernd</author><author>Campbell, Peter</author><author>Carninci, Piero</author><author>Clatworthy, Menna</author><author>Clevers, Hans</author><author>Deplancke, Bart</author><author>Dunham, Ian</author><author>Eberwine, James</author><author>Eils, Roland</author><author>Enard, Wolfgang</author><author>Farmer, Andrew</author><author>Fugger, Lars</author><author>Göttgens, Berthold</author><author>Hacohen, Nir</author><author>Haniffa, Muzlifah</author><author>Hemberg, Martin</author><author>Kim, Seung</author><author>Klenerman, Paul</author><author>Kriegstein, Arnold</author><author>Lein, Ed</author><author>Linnarsson, Sten</author><author>Lundberg, Emma</author><author>Lundeberg, Joakim</author><author>Majumder, Partha</author><author>Marioni, John C.</author><author>Merad, Miriam</author><author>Mhlanga, Musa</author><author>Nawijn, Martijn</author><author>Netea, Mihai</author><author>Nolan, Garry</author><author>Pe'er, Dana</author><author>Phillipakis, Anthony</author><author>Ponting, Chris P.</author><author>Quake, Stephen</author><author>Reik, Wolf</author><author>Rozenblatt-Rosen, Orit</author><author>Sanes, Joshua</author><author>Satija, Rahul</author><author>Schumacher, Ton N.</author><author>Shalek, Alex</author><author>Shapiro, Ehud</author><author>Sharma, Padmanee</author><author>Shin, Jay W.</author><author>Stegle, Oliver</author><author>Stratton, Michael</author><author>Stubbington, Michael J T</author><author>Theis, Fabian J.</author><author>Uhlen, Matthias</author><author>van Oudenaarden, Alexander</author><author>Wagner, Allon</author><author>Watt, Fiona</author><author>Weissman, Jonathan</author><author>Wold, Barbara</author><author>Xavier, Ramnik</author><author>Yosef, Nir</author><author>Human Cell Atlas Meeting Participants</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Human Cell Atlas.</title><secondary-title>eLife</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>eLife</full-title></periodical><pages>1-30</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>cell atlas</keyword><keyword>cell biology</keyword><keyword>computational biology</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>lineage</keyword><keyword>mouse</keyword><keyword>science forum</keyword><keyword>single-cell genomics</keyword><keyword>systems biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>2050-084x</isbn><accession-num>29206104</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.7554/eLife.27041</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Regev et al. - eLife - The Human Cell Atlas.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206104</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5762154</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The recent advent of methods for high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling has catalyzed a growing sense in the scientific community that the time is ripe to complete the 150-year-old effort to identify all cell types in the human body. The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas, including a commitment to open data, code, and community.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Consortium, The HCA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Human Cell Atlas White Paper</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Consortium - Unknown - The Human Cell Atlas White Paper.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206104</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5762154</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hong, Theodore S</author><author>Clark, Jeffrey W</author><author>Haigis, Kevin M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cancers of the colon and rectum: identical or fraternal twins?</title><secondary-title>Cancer discovery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer discovery</full-title></periodical><pages>117-21</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>6176430070</isbn><accession-num>22585856</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0315</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Hong, Clark, Haigis - Cancer discovery - Cancers of the colon and rectum identical or fraternal twins.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.aacrjournals.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22585856</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Colorectal cancer represents a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality, with approximately 1.2 million cases and 600,000 deaths worldwide each year.

The molecular mechanisms that mediate this response occur across many highly complex biological regulatory levels that are incompletely understood. Here, we present a comprehensive molecular systems biology study of hepatic responses to high-fat feeding in mice. We interrogated diet-induced epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic alterations using high-throughput omic methods and used a network modeling approach to integrate these diverse molecular signals. Our model indicated that disruption of hepatic architecture and enhanced hepatocyte apoptosis are among the numerous biological processes that contribute to early liver dysfunction and low-grade inflammation during the development of diet-induced metabolic syndrome. We validated these model findings with additional experiments on mouse liver sections. In total, we present an integrative systems biology study of diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance that uncovered molecular features promoting the development and maintenance of metabolic disease. Soltis et al. performed a systems biology study of obesity-induced hepatic insulin resistance in mice. They collected a variety of omic datasets, including metabolomics, and integrated these into a network model. They tested model predictions and identified widespread hepatocellular injury and enhanced hepatocyte apoptosis as features of hepatic insulin resistance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Shiheng</author><author>Zhao, Ke</author><author>Wang, Xuefei</author><author>Liu, Hui</author><author>Ainiwaer, Xiamuxiya</author><author>Xu, Yan</author><author>Ye, Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of Laplacian Heat Diffusion Algorithm to Infer Novel Genes With Functions Related to Uveitis</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>October</issue><keywords><keyword>authors have contributed</keyword><keyword>disease gene</keyword><keyword>equally to this work</keyword><keyword>laplacian heat diffusion</keyword><keyword>network construction</keyword><keyword>protein</keyword><keyword>protein interaction</keyword><keyword>uveitis</keyword><keyword>uveitis, Laplacian heat diffusion, protein–protein</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fgene.2018.00425</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Lu et al. - Frontiers in Genetics - Use of Laplacian Heat Diffusion Algorithm to Infer Novel Genes With Functions Related to Uvei.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2018.00425/full</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Finicle, Brendan T.</author><author>Jayashankar, Vaishali</author><author>Edinger, Aimee L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nutrient scavenging in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

To overcome this obstacle to growth, cancer cells utilize multiple scavenging strategies, obtaining macromolecules from the microenvironment and breaking them down in the lysosome to produce substrates for ATP generation and anabolism. Recent studies have revealed four scavenging pathways that support cancer cell proliferation in low-nutrient environments: scavenging of extracellular matrix proteins via integrins, receptor-mediated albumin uptake and catabolism, macropinocytic consumption of multiple components of the tumour microenvironment and the engulfment and degradation of entire live cells via entosis. New evidence suggests that blocking these pathways alone or in combination could provide substantial benefits to patients with incurable solid tumours. Both US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and several agents in preclinical or clinical development shut down individual or multiple scavenging pathways. These therapies may increase the extent and durability of tumour growth inhibition and/or prevent the development of resistance when used in combination with existing treatments. This Review summarizes the evidence suggesting that scavenging pathways drive tumour growth, highlights recent advances that define the oncogenic signal transduction pathways that regulate scavenging and considers the benefits and detriments of therapeutic strategies targeting scavenging that are currently under development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cho, Hyunghoon</author><author>Berger, Bonnie</author><author>Peng, Jian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Compact Integration of Multi-Network Topology for Functional Analysis of Genes.</title><secondary-title>Cell systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell systems</full-title></periodical><pages>540-548.e5</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>dimensionality reduction</keyword><keyword>drug response prediction</keyword><keyword>gene function prediction</keyword><keyword>gene ontology reconstruction</keyword><keyword>genetic interaction prediction</keyword><keyword>heterogeneous networks</keyword><keyword>interactome analysis</keyword><keyword>network diffusion</keyword><keyword>network integration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>24054712 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>27889536</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cels.2016.10.017</electronic-resource-num><notes>tool: Mashup</notes><research-notes>tool: Mashup</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Cho, Berger, Peng - Cell systems - Compact Integration of Multi-Network Topology for Functional Analysis of Genes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2016.10.017http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2016.10.017</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27889536</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5225290</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The topological landscape of molecular or functional interaction networks provides a rich source of information for inferring functional patterns of genes or proteins. However, a pressing yet-unsolved challenge is how to combine multiple heterogeneous networks, each having different connectivity patterns, to achieve more accurate inference. Here, we describe the Mashup framework for scalable and robust network integration. In Mashup, the diffusion in each network is first analyzed to characterize the topological context of each node. Next, the high-dimensional topological patterns in individual networks are canonically represented using low-dimensional vectors, one per gene or protein. These vectors can then be plugged into off-the-shelf machine learning methods to derive functional insights about genes or proteins. We present tools based on Mashup that achieve state-of-the-art performance in three diverse functional inference tasks: protein function prediction, gene ontology reconstruction, and genetic interaction prediction. Mashup enables deeper insights into the structure of rapidly accumulating and diverse biological network data and can be broadly applied to other network science domains.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Grace M.</author><author>Wong, Hong Yuen</author><author>Konishi, Hiroyuki</author><author>Blair, Brian G.</author><author>Abukhdeir, Abde M.</author><author>Gustin, John P.</author><author>Rosen, D.

Here, we show that somatic cell knockin of both KRAS G12V and oncogenic PIK3CA mutations in human breast epithelial cells results in cooperative activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in vitro, and leads to tumor formation in immunocompromised mice. Xenografts from double-knockin cells retain single copies of mutant KRAS and PIK3CA, suggesting that tumor formation does not require increased copy number of either oncogene, and these results were also observed in human colorectal cancer specimens. Mechanistically, the cooperativity between mutant KRAS and PIK3CA is mediated in part by Ras/p110α binding, as inactivating point mutations within the Ras-binding domain of PIK3CA significantly abates pathway signaling. In addition, Pdk1 activation of the downstream effector p90RSK is also increased by the combined presence of mutant KRAS and PIK3CA. These results provide new insights into mutant KRAS function and its role in carcinogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharma, A</author><author>Sen, J M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular basis for the tissue specificity of β-catenin oncogenesis.</title><secondary-title>Oncogene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncogene</full-title></periodical><pages>1901-9</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>apoptosis</keyword><keyword>c-Myc</keyword><keyword>hypocellular thymus</keyword><keyword>intestinal adenoma</keyword><keyword>p53</keyword><keyword>β-catenin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1476-5594 (Electronic)\r0950-9232 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>22689057</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/onc.2012.215</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Sharma, Sen - Oncogene - Molecular basis for the tissue specificity of β-catenin oncogenesis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/onc</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22689057</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3534820</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Wnt-β-catenin-T-cell factor signaling is causally linked to c-myc-dependent tumorigenesis in mouse and human colon epithelial cells. By contrast, β-catenin is not similarly associated with oncogenic transformation of other tissues, including T cells. The molecular basis for tissue specificity of β-catenin-dependent oncogenesis is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that adenomatous polyposis coli mutant APC(Min/+) mice, which have increased expression of β-catenin in all tissues, develop severe intestinal neoplasia, but fail to develop thymic lymphoma. Whereas β-catenin-dependent signals elicit a proliferative response from intestinal cells, thymocytes experience oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), growth arrest and apoptosis. We demonstrate that the differential cellular response of thymocytes and intestinal epithelial cells is a direct consequence of the gene expression elicited by β-catenin expression in each tissue. We find that whereas intestinal cells induce genes that promote proliferation thymocytes induce expression of genes associated with OIS, growth arrest and p53-dependent apoptosis. We correlate gene expression pattern with the role β-catenin plays in the development of each tissue and suggest that susceptibility of transformation by β-catenin is intimately related to its function during development. We propose that when oncogenes are used as signaling molecules, safety nets in the form of OIS, growth arrest and apoptosis prevent accidental transformation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schaefer, Martin H</author><author>Serrano, Luis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell type-specific properties and environment shape tissue specificity of cancer genes</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>6</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>2045-2322</isbn><accession-num>26856619</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep20707</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Schaefer, Serrano - Scientific Reports - Cell type-specific properties and environment shape tissue specificity of cancer genes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/scientificreports/</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:tissuespec</label><abstract>One of the biggest mysteries in cancer research remains why mutations in certain genes cause cancer only at specific sites in the human body. The poor correlation between the expression level of a cancer gene and the tissues in which it causes malignant transformations raises the question of which factors determine the tissue-specific effects of a mutation. Here, we explore why some cancer genes are associated only with few different cancer types (i.e., are specific), while others are found mutated in a large number of different types of cancer (i.e., are general). We do so by contrasting cellular functions of specific-cancer genes with those of general ones to identify properties that determine where in the body a gene mutation is causing malignant transformations. We identified different groups of cancer genes that did not behave as expected (i.e., DNA repair genes being tissue specific, immune response genes showing a bimodal specificity function or strong association of generally expressed genes to particular cancers). Analysis of these three groups demonstrates the importance of environmental impact for understanding why certain cancer genes are only involved in the development of some cancer types but are rarely found mutated in other types of cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Muzumdar, Mandar Deepak</author><author>Dorans, Kimberly Judith</author><author>Chung, Katherine Minjee</author><author>Robbins, Rebecca</author><author>Tammela, Tuomas</author><author>Gocheva, Vasilena</author><author>Li, Carman Man-Chung</author><author>Jacks, Tyler</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clonal dynamics following p53 loss of heterozygosity in Kras-driven cancers.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>12685</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>2041-1723 (Electronic)\r2041-1723 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>27585860</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms12685</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Muzumdar et al. - Nature communications - Clonal dynamics following p53 loss of heterozygosity in Kras-driven cancers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/naturecommunications</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27585860</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5025814</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Although it has become increasingly clear that cancers display extensive cellular heterogeneity, the spatial growth dynamics of genetically distinct clones within developing solid tumours remain poorly understood. Here we leverage mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) to trace subclonal populations retaining or lacking p53 within oncogenic Kras-initiated lung and pancreatic tumours. In both models, p53 constrains progression to advanced adenocarcinomas. Comparison of lineage-related p53 knockout and wild-type clones reveals a minor role of p53 in suppressing cell expansion in lung adenomas. In contrast, p53 loss promotes both the initiation and expansion of low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs), likely through differential expression of the p53 regulator p19ARF. Strikingly, lineage-related cells are often dispersed in lung adenomas and PanINs, contrasting with more contiguous growth of advanced subclones. Together, these results support cancer type-specific suppressive roles of p53 in early tumour progression and offer insights into clonal growth patterns during tumour development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barradas-Bautista, Didier</author><author>Alvarado-Mentado, Matias</author><author>Agostino, Mark</author><author>Cocho, Germinal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cancer growth and metastasis as a metaphor of Go gaming: An Ising model approach.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0195654</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>29718932</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0195654</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Barradas-Bautista et al. - PloS one - Cancer growth and metastasis as a metaphor of Go gaming An Ising model approach.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0195654</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29718932</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5931478</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This work aims for modeling and simulating the metastasis of cancer, via the analogy between the cancer process and the board game Go. In the game of Go, black stones that play first could correspond to a metaphor of the birth, growth, and metastasis of cancer. Moreover, playing white stones on the second turn could correspond the inhibition of cancer invasion. Mathematical modeling and algorithmic simulation of Go may therefore benefit the efforts to deploy therapies to surpass cancer illness by providing insight into the cellular growth and expansion over a tissue area. We use the Ising Hamiltonian, that models the energy exchange in interacting particles, for modeling the cancer dynamics.

Testing diverse genetic and epigenetic features, here we show that mutation rates in cancer genomes are strikingly related to chromatin organization. Indeed, at the megabase scale, a single feature—levels of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3—can account for more than 40% of mutation-rate variation, and a combination of features can account for more than 55%. The strong association between mutation rates and chromatin organization is upheld in samples from different tissues and for different mutation types. This suggests that the arrangement of the genome into heterochromatin- and euchromatin-like domains is a dominant influence on regional mutation-rate variation in human somatic cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Young, Nathan P</author><author>Jacks, Tyler</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tissue-specific p19Arf regulation dictates the response to oncogenic K-ras.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>10184-9</pages><volume>107</volume><issue>22</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1091-6490 (Electronic)\r0027-8424 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>20479239</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1004796107</electronic-resource-num><notes>mentions &amp;quot;latent&amp;quot; Kras G12D mouse model</notes><research-notes>mentions &amp;quot;latent&amp;quot; Kras G12D mouse model</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Young, Jacks - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Tissue-specific p19Arf regulatio.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1004796107</url><url>http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1004796107</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479239</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2890471</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:tissuespec</label><abstract>The ability of oncogenes to engage tumor suppressor pathways represents a key regulatory mechanism that can limit the outgrowth of incipient tumor cells. For example, in a number of settings oncogenic Ras strongly activates the Ink4a/Arf locus, resulting in cell cycle arrest or senescence. The capacity of different cell types to execute tumor suppressor programs following expression of endogenous K-ras(G12D) in vivo has not been examined. Using compound mutant mice containing the Arf(GFP) reporter and the spontaneously activating K-ras(LA2) allele, we have uncovered dramatic tissue specificity of K-ras(G12D)-dependent p19(Arf) up-regulation. Lung tumors, which can arise in the presence of functional p19(Arf), rarely display p19(Arf) induction. In contrast, sarcomas always show robust activation, which correlates with genetic evidence, suggesting that loss of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway is a requisite event for sarcomagenesis. Using constitutive and inducible RNAi systems in vivo, we highlight cell type-specific chromatin regulation of Ink4a/Arf as a critical determinant of cellular responses to oncogenic K-ras. Polycomb-group complexes repress the locus in lung tumors, whereas the SWI/SNF family member Snf5 acts as an important mediator of p19(Arf) induction in sarcomas. This variation in tumor suppressor induction might explain the inherent differences between tissues in their sensitivity to Ras-mediated transformation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Pora</author><author>Park, Aekyung</author><author>Han, Guangchun</author><author>Sun, Hua</author><author>Jia, Peilin</author><author>Zhao, Zhongming</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TissGDB: tissue-specific gene database in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D1031-D1038</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>D1</issue><keywords><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>gene expression</keyword><keyword>genes</keyword><keyword>mutation</keyword><keyword>patient prognosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><isbn>13624962 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>29036590</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkx850</electronic-resource-num><notes>tissue-specific gene expression resources: The Human Protein Atlas (HPA), Tissue- specific Gene Expression and Regulation (TiGER), and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)</notes><research-notes>tissue-specific gene expression resources: The Human Protein Atlas (HPA), Tissue- specific Gene Expression and Regulation (TiGER), and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Kim et al. - Nucleic acids research - TissGDB tissue-specific gene database in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/D1/D1031/4210940</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29036590</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5753286</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:tissuespec</label><abstract>Tissue-specific gene expression is critical in understanding biological processes, physiological conditions, and disease. The identification and appropriate use of tissue-specific genes (TissGenes) will provide important insights into disease mechanisms and organ-specific therapeutic targets. To better understand the tissue-specific features for each cancer type and to advance the discovery of clinically relevant genes or mutations, we built TissGDB (Tissue specific Gene DataBase in cancer) available at http://zhaobioinfo.org/TissGDB. We collected and curated 2461 tissue specific genes (TissGenes) across 22 tissue types that matched the 28 cancer types of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) from three representative tissue-specific gene expression resources: The Human Protein Atlas (HPA), Tissue-specific Gene Expression and Regulation (TiGER), and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). For these 2461 TissGenes, we performed gene expression, somatic mutation, and prognostic marker-based analyses across 28 cancer types using TCGA data. Our analyses identified hundreds of TissGenes, including genes that universally kept or lost tissue-specific gene expression, with other features: cancer type-specific isoform expression, fusion with oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, and markers for protective or risk prognosis. TissGDB provides seven categories of annotations: TissGeneSummary, TissGeneExp, TissGene-miRNA, TissGeneMut, TissGeneNet, TissGeneProg, TissGeneClin.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haigis, Kevin M</author><author>Kendall, Krystle R</author><author>Wang, Yufang</author><author>Cheung, Ann</author><author>Haigis, Marcia C</author><author>Glickman, Jonathan N</author><author>Niwa-Kawakita, Michiko</author><author>Sweet-Cordero, Alejandro</author><author>Sebolt-Leopold, Judith</author><author>Shannon, Kevin M</author><author>Settleman, Jeffrey</author><author>Giovannini, Marco</author><author>Jacks, Tyler</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential effects of oncogenic K-Ras and N-Ras on proliferation, differentiation and tumor progression in the colon.</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>600-8</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><isbn>1546-1718 (Electronic)\r1061-4036 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>18372904</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng.115</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2008 - Haigis et al. - Nature genetics - Differential effects of oncogenic K-Ras and N-Ras on proliferation, differentiation and tumor p.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/naturegenetics</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18372904</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2410301</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Kras is commonly mutated in colon cancers, but mutations in Nras are rare. We have used genetically engineered mice to determine whether and how these related oncogenes regulate homeostasis and tumorigenesis in the colon. Expression of K-Ras(G12D) in the colonic epithelium stimulated hyperproliferation in a Mek-dependent manner. N-Ras(G12D) did not alter the growth properties of the epithelium, but was able to confer resistance to apoptosis. In the context of an Apc-mutant colonic tumor, activation of K-Ras led to defects in terminal differentiation and expansion of putative stem cells within the tumor epithelium. This K-Ras tumor phenotype was associated with attenuated signaling through the MAPK pathway, and human colon cancer cells expressing mutant K-Ras were hypersensitive to inhibition of Raf, but not Mek. These studies demonstrate clear phenotypic differences between mutant Kras and Nras, and suggest that the oncogenic phenotype of mutant K-Ras might be mediated by noncanonical signaling through Ras effector pathways.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coyle, Scott M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reverse engineering GTPase programming languages with reconstituted signaling networks</title><secondary-title>Small GTPases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Small GTPases</full-title></periodical><pages>168-172</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Ras</keyword><keyword>biochemistry</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>in vitro reconstitution</keyword><keyword>signaling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/21541248.2016.1178367</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Coyle - Small GTPases - Reverse engineering GTPase programming languages with reconstituted signaling networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21541248.2016.1178367</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coyle, Scott M.</author><author>Lim, Wendell A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping the functional versatility and fragility of Ras GTPase signaling circuits through in vitro network reconstitution</title><secondary-title>eLife</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>eLife</full-title></periodical><pages>1-34</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>JANUARY2016</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26765565</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.7554/eLife.12435.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>in vitro bead-based assay for Ras association with different up/downstram partners</notes><research-notes>in vitro bead-based assay for Ras association with different up/downstram partners</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Coyle, Lim - eLife - Mapping the functional versatility and fragility of Ras GTPase signaling circuits through in vitro network r.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Ras-superfamily GTPases are central controllers of cell proliferation and morphology. Ras signaling is mediated by a system of interacting molecules: upstream enzymes (GEF/GAP) regulate Ras’s ability to recruit multiple competing downstream effectors. We developed a multiplexed, multi-turnover assay for measuring the dynamic signaling behavior of in vitro reconstituted H-Ras signaling systems. By including both upstream regulators and downstream effectors, we can systematically map how different network configurations shape the dynamic system response. The concentration and identity of both upstream and downstream signaling components strongly impacted the timing, duration, shape, and amplitude of effector outputs. The distorted output of oncogenic alleles of Ras was highly dependent on the balance of positive (GAP) and negative (GEF) regulators in the system. We found that different effectors interpreted the same inputs with distinct output dynamics, enabling a Ras system to encode multiple unique temporal outputs in response to a single input. We also found that different Ras-to-GEF positive feedback mechanisms could reshape output dynamics in distinct ways, such as signal amplification or overshoot minimization. Mapping of the space of output behaviors accessible to Ras provides a design manual for programming Ras circuits, and reveals how these systems are readily adapted to produce an array of dynamic signaling behaviors. Nonetheless, this versatility comes with a trade-off of fragility, as there exist numerous paths to altered signaling behaviors that could cause disease.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fang, Zhenhao</author><author>Marshall, Christopher B</author><author>Yin, Jiani C</author><author>Mazhab-Jafari, Mohammad T</author><author>Gasmi-Seabrook, Geneviève M C</author><author>Smith, Matthew J</author><author>Nishikawa, Tadateru</author><author>Xu, Yang</author><author>Neel, Benjamin G</author><author>Ikura, Mitsuhiko</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biochemical Classification of Disease-associated Mutants of RAS-like Protein Expressed in Many Tissues (RIT1).</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>15641-52</pages><volume>291</volume><issue>30</issue><keywords><keyword>GTP hydrolysis</keyword><keyword>Noonan Syndrome</keyword><keyword>RIT1</keyword><keyword>Ras protein</keyword><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)</keyword><keyword>nucleotide exchange</keyword><keyword>small GTPase</keyword><keyword>structure-function</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>0021-9258</isbn><accession-num>27226556</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M116.714196</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Fang et al. - The Journal of biological chemistry - Biochemical Classification of Disease-associated Mutants of RAS-like Protein.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jbc.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27226556</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4957048</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>RAS-like protein expressed in many tissues 1 (RIT1) is a disease-associated RAS subfamily small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase). Recent studies revealed that germ-line and somatic RIT1 mutations can cause Noonan syndrome (NS), and drive proliferation of lung adenocarcinomas, respectively, akin to RAS mutations in these diseases. However, the locations of these RIT1 mutations differ significantly from those found in RAS, and do not affect the three mutational &quot;hot spots&quot; of RAS. Moreover, few studies have characterized the GTPase cycle of RIT1 and its disease-associated mutants. Here we developed a real-time NMR-based GTPase assay for RIT1 and investigated the effect of disease-associated mutations on GTPase cycle. RIT1 exhibits an intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate similar to that of H-RAS, but its intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate is ∼4-fold faster, likely as a result of divergent residues near the nucleotide binding site. All of the disease-associated mutations investigated increased the GTP-loaded, activated state of RIT1 in vitro, but they could be classified into two groups with different intrinsic GTPase properties. The S35T, A57G, and Y89H mutants exhibited more rapid nucleotide exchange, whereas F82V and T83P impaired GTP hydrolysis. A RAS-binding domain pulldown assay indicated that RIT1 A57G and Y89H were highly activated in HEK293T cells, whereas T83P and F82V exhibited more modest activation. All five mutations are associated with NS, whereas two (A57G and F82V) have also been identified in urinary tract cancers and myeloid malignancies. Characterization of the effects on the GTPase cycle of RIT1 disease-associated mutations should enable better understanding of their role in disease processes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Christian W</author><author>Reid, Derion</author><author>Parker, Jillian A</author><author>Salter, Shores</author><author>Knihtila, Ryan</author><author>Kuzmic, Petr</author><author>Mattos, Carla</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The small GTPases K-Ras, N-Ras, and H-Ras have distinct biochemical properties determined by allosteric effects.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>12981-12993</pages><volume>292</volume><issue>31</issue><keywords><keyword>Ras protein</keyword><keyword>allosteric regulation</keyword><keyword>conformational change</keyword><keyword>enzyme catalysis</keyword><keyword>enzyme structure</keyword><keyword>oncogene</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28630043</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M117.778886</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Johnson et al. - The Journal of biological chemistry - The small GTPases K-Ras, N-Ras, and H-Ras have distinct biochemical proper.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jbc.org/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28630043</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5546037</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras are small GTPases that are important in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and their mutants occur frequently in human cancers. The G-domain, which catalyzes GTP hydrolysis and mediates downstream signaling, is 95% conserved between the Ras isoforms. Because of their very high sequence identity, biochemical studies done on H-Ras have been considered representative of all three Ras proteins. We show here that this is not a valid assumption. Using enzyme kinetic assays under identical conditions, we observed clear differences between the three isoforms in intrinsic catalysis of GTP by Ras in the absence and presence of the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of the c-Raf kinase protein (Raf-RBD). Given their identical active sites, isoform G-domain differences must be allosteric in origin, due to remote isoform-specific residues that affect conformational states. We present the crystal structure of N-Ras bound to a GTP analogue and interpret the kinetic data in terms of structural features specific for H-, K-, and N-Ras.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, Matthew J</author><author>Ikura, Mitsuhiko</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrated RAS signaling defined by parallel NMR detection of effectors and regulators.</title><secondary-title>Nature chemical biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature chemical biology</full-title></periodical><pages>223-30</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1552-4469 (Electronic)\r1552-4450 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>24441586</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nchembio.1435</electronic-resource-num><notes>an in vitro NMR-based technique for measuring competitive interaction

Oncogenic mutation of RAS alters cell growth by deleteriously controlling output to RAS-binding effectors. Mechanisms underlying multieffector interactions for both wild-type and oncogenic RAS are poorly understood owing to challenges in quantifying outputs to multiple pathways in parallel. Using highly selective NMR probes for wild-type and oncogenic (G12V) RAS, we develop a systematic approach that quantitatively measures RAS output in composite mixtures of GEF, GAP and effector RAS-binding domains (RBDs). We derive effector signaling hierarchies and establish how oscillating concentrations generate effector 'switching'. The G12V mutation highly perturbs this system, specifically altering interactions with RAL GTPase-specific GEFs and RAF kinases. We further reveal that RAS-RBD complexes show extensive feedback to full-length regulatory proteins. Our approach quantifies output from signaling hubs, here providing an integrated view of the RAS network.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Xiaoguang</author><author>Edwards, Marc</author><author>Swaney, Kristen F</author><author>Singh, Nilmani</author><author>Bhattacharya, Sayak</author><author>Borleis, Jane</author><author>Long, Yu</author><author>Iglesias, Pablo A</author><author>Chen, Jie</author><author>Devreotes, Peter N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutually inhibitory Ras-PI(3,4)P2 feedback loops mediate cell migration.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>E9125-E9134</pages><volume>115</volume><issue>39</issue><keywords><keyword>chemotaxis</keyword><keyword>excitability</keyword><keyword>phosphoinositides</keyword><keyword>positive feedback loop</keyword><keyword>signal transduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30194235</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1809039115</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Li et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Mutually inhibitory Ras-PI(3,4)P2 f.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1809039115</url><url>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles/~3/lgCtOWcE5Oc/1809039115.short</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30194235</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Signal transduction and cytoskeleton networks in a wide variety of cells display excitability, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that during random migration and in response to chemoattractants, cells maintain complementary spatial and temporal distributions of Ras activity and phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2]. In addition, depletion of PI(3,4)P2 by disruption of the 5-phosphatase, Dd5P4, or by recruitment of 4-phosphatase INPP4B to the plasma membrane, leads to elevated Ras activity, cell spreading, and altered migratory behavior. Furthermore, RasGAP2 and RapGAP3 bind to PI(3,4)P2, and the phenotypes of cells lacking these genes mimic those with low PI(3,4)P2 levels, providing a molecular mechanism. These findings suggest that Ras activity drives PI(3,4)P2 down, causing the PI(3,4)P2-binding GAPs to dissociate from the membrane, further activating Ras, completing a positive-feedback loop essential for excitability. Consistently, a computational model incorporating such a feedback loop in an excitable network model accurately simulates the dynamic distributions of active Ras and PI(3,4)P2 as well as cell migratory behavior. The mutually inhibitory Ras-PI(3,4)P2 mechanisms we uncovered here provide a framework for Ras regulation that may play a key role in many physiological processes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Papadopoulos, Lia</author><author>Blinder, Pablo</author><author>Ronellenfitsch, Henrik</author><author>Klimm, Florian</author><author>Katifori, Eleni</author><author>Kleinfeld, David</author><author>Bassett, Danielle S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparing two classes of biological distribution systems using network analysis.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1006428</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>30192745</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006428</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Papadopoulos et al. - PLoS computational biology - Comparing two classes of biological distribution systems using network analysi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006428&amp;type=printable</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30192745</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6145589</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Distribution networks-from vasculature to urban transportation pathways-are spatially embedded networks that must route resources efficiently in the face of pressures induced by the costs of building and maintaining network infrastructure. Such requirements are thought to constrain the topological and spatial organization of these systems, but at the same time, different kinds of distribution networks may exhibit variable architectural features within those general constraints. In this study, we use methods from network science to compare and contrast two classes of biological transport networks: mycelial fungi and vasculature from the surface of rodent brains. These systems differ in terms of their growth and transport mechanisms, as well as the environments in which they typically exist. Though both types of networks have been studied independently, the goal of this study is to quantify similarities and differences in their network designs. We begin by characterizing the structural backbone of these systems with a collection of measures that assess various kinds of network organization across topological and spatial scales, ranging from measures of loop density, to those that quantify connected pathways between different network regions, and hierarchical organization. Most importantly, we next carry out a network analysis that directly considers the spatial embedding and properties especially relevant to the function of distribution systems. We find that although both the vasculature and mycelia are highly constrained planar networks, there are clear distinctions in how they balance tradeoffs in network measures of wiring length, efficiency, and robustness. While the vasculature appears well organized for low cost, but relatively high efficiency, the mycelia tend to form more expensive but in turn more robust networks. As a whole, this work demonstrates the utility of network-based methods to identify both common features and variations in the network structure of different classes of biological transport systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moulos, Panagiotis</author><author>Klein, Julie</author><author>Jupp, Simon</author><author>Stevens, Robert</author><author>Bascands, Jean-Loup</author><author>Schanstra, Joost P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The KUPNetViz: a biological network viewer for multiple -omics datasets in kidney diseases.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>235</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Combinatorial Libraries</keyword><keyword>Computational Biology/Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Computer Appl. in Life Sciences</keyword><keyword>Microarrays</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><accession-num>23883183</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-14-235</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Moulos et al. - BMC bioinformatics - The KUPNetViz a biological network viewer for multiple -omics datasets in kidney diseases.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-235</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23883183</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3725151</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Constant technological advances have allowed scientists in biology to migrate from conventional single-omics to multi-omics experimental approaches, challenging bioinformatics to bridge this multi-tiered information. Ongoing research in renal biology is no exception. The results of large-scale and/or high throughput experiments, presenting a wealth of information on kidney disease are scattered across the web. To tackle this problem, we recently presented the KUPKB, a multi-omics data repository for renal diseases. RESULTS In this article, we describe KUPNetViz, a biological graph exploration tool allowing the exploration of KUPKB data through the visualization of biomolecule interactions. KUPNetViz enables the integration of multi-layered experimental data over different species, renal locations and renal diseases to protein-protein interaction networks and allows association with biological functions, biochemical pathways and other functional elements such as miRNAs. KUPNetViz focuses on the simplicity of its usage and the clarity of resulting networks by reducing and/or automating advanced functionalities present in other biological network visualization packages. In addition, it allows the extrapolation of biomolecule interactions across different species, leading to the formulations of new plausible hypotheses, adequate experiment design and to the suggestion of novel biological mechanisms. We demonstrate the value of KUPNetViz by two usage examples: the integration of calreticulin as a key player in a larger interaction network in renal graft rejection and the novel observation of the strong association of interleukin-6 with polycystic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS The KUPNetViz is an interactive and flexible biological network visualization and exploration tool. It provides renal biologists with biological network snapshots of the complex integrated data of the KUPKB allowing the formulation of new hypotheses in a user friendly manner.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pavlopoulos, Georgios A</author><author>Wegener, Anna-Lynn</author><author>Schneider, Reinhard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A survey of visualization tools for biological network analysis.</title><secondary-title>BioData mining</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioData mining</full-title></periodical><pages>12</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Computational Biology/Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Computer Appl. in Life Sciences</keyword><keyword>Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><isbn>1756-0381 (Electronic)\r1756-0381 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>19040716</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1756-0381-1-12</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2008 - Pavlopoulos, Wegener, Schneider - BioData mining - A survey of visualization tools for biological network analysis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://biodatamining.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-0381-1-12</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19040716</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2636684</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The analysis and interpretation of relationships between biological molecules, networks and concepts is becoming a major bottleneck in systems biology. Very often the pure amount of data and their heterogeneity provides a challenge for the visualization of the data. There are a wide variety of graph representations available, which most often map the data on 2D graphs to visualize biological interactions. These methods are applicable to a wide range of problems, nevertheless many of them reach a limit in terms of user friendliness when thousands of nodes and connections have to be analyzed and visualized. In this study we are reviewing visualization tools that are currently available for visualization of biological networks mainly invented in the latest past years.

Networks of genes, proteins, small molecules, or other objects of study can be represented as graphs of nodes (vertices) and interactions (edges) that can carry different weights. SpectralNET is a flexible application for analyzing and visualizing these biological and chemical networks. RESULTS Available both as a standalone .NET executable and as an ASP.NET web application, SpectralNET was designed specifically with the analysis of graph-theoretic metrics in mind, a computational task not easily accessible using currently available applications. Users can choose either to upload a network for analysis using a variety of input formats, or to have SpectralNET generate an idealized random network for comparison to a real-world dataset. Whichever graph-generation method is used, SpectralNET displays detailed information about each connected component of the graph, including graphs of degree distribution, clustering coefficient by degree, and average distance by degree. In addition, extensive information about the selected vertex is shown, including degree, clustering coefficient, various distance metrics, and the corresponding components of the adjacency, Laplacian, and normalized Laplacian eigenvectors. SpectralNET also displays several graph visualizations, including a linear dimensionality reduction for uploaded datasets (Principal Components Analysis) and a non-linear dimensionality reduction that provides an elegant view of global graph structure (Laplacian eigenvectors). CONCLUSION SpectralNET provides an easily accessible means of analyzing graph-theoretic metrics for data modeling and dimensionality reduction. SpectralNET is publicly available as both a .NET application and an ASP.NET web application from http://chembank.broad.harvard.edu/resources/.

The combined framework of network theory and spectral graph theory along with the multilayer analysis provides a comprehensive approach to analyze the proteomic data of seven different cancers, namely, breast, oral, ovarian, cervical, lung, colon and prostate. Our analysis demonstrates that the protein-protein interaction networks of the normal and the cancerous tissues associated with the seven cancers have overall similar structural and spectral properties. However, few of these properties implicate unsystematic changes from the normal to the disease networks depicting difference in the interactions and highlighting changes in the complexity of different cancers. Importantly, analysis of common proteins of all the cancer networks reveals few proteins namely the sensors, which not only occupy significant position in all the layers but also have direct involvement in causing cancer. The prediction and analysis of miRNAs targeting these sensor proteins hint towards the possible role of these proteins in tumorigenesis. This novel approach helps in understanding cancer at the fundamental level and provides a clue to develop promising and nascent concept of single drug therapy for multiple diseases as well as personalized medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Banerjee, Anirban</author><author>Jost, Jürgen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Graph spectra as a systematic tool in computational biology</title><secondary-title>Discrete Applied Mathematics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Discrete Applied Mathematics</full-title></periodical><pages>2425-2431</pages><volume>157</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological network</keyword><keyword>Foodweb</keyword><keyword>Graph evolution</keyword><keyword>Graph spectrum</keyword><keyword>Metabolic network</keyword><keyword>Neuronal network</keyword><keyword>Protein-protein interaction network</keyword><keyword>Spectral plot</keyword><keyword>Transcription network</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dam.2008.06.033</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Banerjee, Jost - Discrete Applied Mathematics - Graph spectra as a systematic tool in computational biology.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.elsevier.com/locate/dam</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We present the spectrum of the (normalized) graph Laplacian as a systematic tool for the investigation of networks, and we describe basic properties of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

However, there is currently no satisfactory method to construct an integrated cellular network that combines the gene regulatory network and the signaling regulatory pathway. RESULTS In this study, we integrated different kinds of omics data and developed a systematic method to construct the integrated cellular network based on coupling dynamic models and statistical assessments. The proposed method was applied to S. cerevisiae stress responses, elucidating the stress response mechanism of the yeast. From the resulting integrated cellular network under hyperosmotic stress, the highly connected hubs which are functionally relevant to the stress response were identified. Beyond hyperosmotic stress, the integrated network under heat shock and oxidative stress were also constructed and the crosstalks of these networks were analyzed, specifying the significance of some transcription factors to serve as the decision-making devices at the center of the bow-tie structure and the crucial role for rapid adaptation scheme to respond to stress. In addition, the predictive power of the proposed method was also demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS We successfully construct the integrated cellular network which is validated by literature evidences. The integration of transcription regulations and protein-protein interactions gives more insight into the actual biological network and is more predictive than those without integration. The method is shown to be powerful and flexible and can be used under different conditions and for different species. The coupling dynamic models of the whole integrated cellular network are very useful for theoretical analyses and for further experiments in the fields of network biology and synthetic biology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guo, Zheng</author><author>Wang, Lei</author><author>Li, Yongjin</author><author>Gong, Xue</author><author>Yao, Chen</author><author>Ma, Wencai</author><author>Wang, Dong</author><author>Li, Yanhui</author><author>Zhu, Jing</author><author>Zhang, Min</author><author>Yang, Da</author><author>Rao, Shaoqi</author><author>Wang, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Edge-based scoring and searching method for identifying condition-responsive protein-protein interaction sub-network.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>2121-8</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>1367-4811 (Electronic)\r1367-4803 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>17545181</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btm294</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Guo et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Edge-based scoring and searching method for identifying condition-responsive prot.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/23/16/2121/198073</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17545181</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION Current high-throughput protein-protein interaction (PPI) data do not provide information about the condition(s) under which the interactions occur. Thus, the identification of condition-responsive PPI sub-networks is of great importance for investigating how a living cell adapts to changing environments. RESULTS In this article, we propose a novel edge-based scoring and searching approach to extract a PPI sub-network responsive to conditions related to some investigated gene expression profiles. Using this approach, what we constructed is a sub-network connected by the selected edges (interactions), instead of only a set of vertices (proteins) as in previous works. Furthermore, we suggest a systematic approach to evaluate the biological relevance of the identified responsive sub-network by its ability of capturing condition-relevant functional modules. We apply the proposed method to analyze a human prostate cancer dataset and a yeast cell cycle dataset. The results demonstrate that the edge-based method is able to efficiently capture relevant protein interaction behaviors under the investigated conditions.

Molecules are nodes of this network, and the interactions between them are edges. The architecture of molecular networks can reveal important principles of cellular organization and function, similarly to the way that protein structure tells us about the function and organization of a protein. Computational analysis of molecular networks has been primarily concerned with node degree [Wagner, A. &amp; Fell, D. A. (2001) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 268, 1803-1810; Jeong, H., Tombor, B., Albert, R., Oltvai, Z. N. &amp; Barabasi, A. L. (2000) Nature 407, 651-654] or degree correlation [Maslov, S. &amp; Sneppen, K. (2002) Science 296, 910-913], and hence focused on single/two-body properties of these networks. Here, by analyzing the multibody structure of the network of protein-protein interactions, we discovered molecular modules that are densely connected within themselves but sparsely connected with the rest of the network. Comparison with experimental data and functional annotation of genes showed two types of modules: (i) protein complexes (splicing machinery, transcription factors, etc.) and (ii) dynamic functional units (signaling cascades, cell-cycle regulation, etc.). Discovered modules are highly statistically significant, as is evident from comparison with random graphs, and are robust to noise in the data. Our results provide strong support for the network modularity principle introduced by Hartwell et al. [Hartwell, L. H., Hopfield, J. J., Leibler, S. &amp; Murray, A. W. (1999) Nature 402, C47-C52], suggesting that found modules constitute the &quot;building blocks&quot; of molecular networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barabási, Albert-László</author><author>Gulbahce, Natali</author><author>Loscalzo, Joseph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Network medicine: a network-based approach to human disease.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

The emerging tools of network medicine offer a platform to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of a particular disease, leading to the identification of disease modules and pathways, but also the molecular relationships among apparently distinct (patho)phenotypes. Advances in this direction are essential for identifying new disease genes, for uncovering the biological significance of disease-associated mutations identified by genome-wide association studies and full-genome sequencing, and for identifying drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitra, Koyel</author><author>Carvunis, Anne-Ruxandra</author><author>Ramesh, Sanath Kumar</author><author>Ideker, Trey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrative approaches for finding modular structure in biological networks.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

To this end, large and complex networks of molecular interactions are being rapidly generated for humans and model organisms. A recent focus of bioinformatics research has been to integrate these networks with each other and with diverse molecular profiles to identify sets of molecules and interactions that participate in a common biological function - that is, 'modules'. Here, we classify such integrative approaches into four broad categories, describe their bioinformatic principles and review their applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ciriello, Giovanni</author><author>Cerami, Ethan</author><author>Sander, Chris</author><author>Schultz, Nikolaus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutual exclusivity analysis identifies oncogenic network modules.</title><secondary-title>Genome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome research</full-title></periodical><pages>398-406</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>1549-5469</isbn><accession-num>21908773</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.125567.111</electronic-resource-num><notes>used in HotNet2</notes><research-notes>used in HotNet2</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Ciriello et al. - Genome research - Mutual exclusivity analysis identifies oncogenic network modules.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.125567.111.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21908773</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3266046</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>Although individual tumors of the same clinical type have surprisingly diverse genomic alterations, these events tend to occur in a limited number of pathways, and alterations that affect the same pathway tend to not co-occur in the same patient. While pathway analysis has been a powerful tool in cancer genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic pathway modules is incomplete. To systematically identify such modules, we have developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in cancer (MEMo). The method uses correlation analysis and statistical tests to identify network modules by three criteria: (1) Member genes are recurrently altered across a set of tumor samples; (2) member genes are known to or are likely to participate in the same biological process; and (3) alteration events within the modules are mutually exclusive. Applied to data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the method identifies the principal known altered modules in glioblastoma (GBM) and highlights the striking mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations in the PI(3)K, p53, and Rb pathways. In serous ovarian cancer, we make the novel observation that inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is mutually exclusive of amplification of CCNE1 and inactivation of RB1, suggesting distinct alternative causes of genomic instability in this cancer type; and, we identify RBBP8 as a candidate oncogene involved in Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When applied to any cancer genomics data set, the algorithm can nominate oncogenic alterations that have a particularly strong selective effect and may also be useful in the design of therapeutic combinations in cases where mutual exclusivity reflects synthetic lethality.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berkhin, Pavel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bookmark-coloring algorithm for personalized pagerank computing</title><secondary-title>Internet Mathematics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Internet Mathematics</full-title></periodical><pages>41-62</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/15427951.2006.10129116</electronic-resource-num><notes>used by HotNet2</notes><research-notes>used by HotNet2</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2006 - Berkhin - Internet Mathematics - Bookmark-coloring algorithm for personalized pagerank computing.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.im/1175266367</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We introduce a novel bookmark-coloring algorithm (BCA) that computes authority weights over the web pages utilizing the web hyperlink structure.

Our aims were to identify shared and unique molecular features, clinically significant subtypes, and potential therapeutic targets. We found 61 somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) and 46 significantly mutated genes (SMGs). Eleven SCNAs and 11 SMGs had not been identified in previous TCGA studies of the individual tumor types. We found functionally significant estrogen receptor-regulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and gene/lncRNA interaction networks. Pathway analysis identified subtypes with high leukocyte infiltration, raising potential implications for immunotherapy. Using 16 key molecular features, we identified five prognostic subtypes and developed a decision tree that classified patients into the subtypes based on just six features that are assessable in clinical laboratories.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chung, Fan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The heat kernel as the pagerank of a graph</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>19735-19740</pages><volume>104</volume><issue>50</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>9781450329569</isbn><accession-num>18077407</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.0708838104</electronic-resource-num><notes>used by HotNet2</notes><research-notes>used by HotNet2</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Chung - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - The heat kernel as the pagerank of a graph.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.pnas.orgcgidoi10.1073pnas.0708838104</url><url>http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0708838104</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>The concept of pagerank was first started as a way for determining the ranking of Web pages by Web search engines. Based on relations in interconnected networks, pagerank has become a major tool for addressing fundamental problems arising in general graphs, especially for large information networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes. A notable notion of pagerank, introduced by Brin and Page and denoted by PageRank, is based on random walks as a geometric sum. In this paper, we consider a notion of pagerank that is based on the (discrete) heat kernel and can be expressed as an exponential sum of random walks. The heat kernel satisfies the heat equation and can be used to analyze many useful properties of random walks in a graph. A local Cheeger inequality is established, which implies that, by focusing on cuts determined by linear orderings of vertices using the heat kernel pageranks, the resulting partition is within a quadratic factor of the optimum. This is true, even if we restrict the volume of the small part separated by the cut to be close to some specified target value. This leads to a graph partitioning algorithm for which the running time is proportional to the size of the targeted volume (instead of the size of the whole graph).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hobbs, G Aaron</author><author>Wittinghofer, Alfred</author><author>Der, Channing J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Selective Targeting of the KRAS G12C Mutant: Kicking KRAS When It's Down.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>251-253</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1878-3686 (Electronic)\r1535-6108 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>26977877</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2016.02.015</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Hobbs, Wittinghofer, Der - Cancer cell - Selective Targeting of the KRAS G12C Mutant Kicking KRAS When It's Down.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2016.02.015</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26977877</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Two recent studies evaluated a small molecule that specifically binds to and inactivates the KRAS G12C mutant.

We perform a pan-cancer analysis of mutated networks in 3,281 samples from 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using HotNet2, a new algorithm to find mutated subnetworks that overcomes the limitations of existing single-gene, pathway and network approaches. We identify 16 significantly mutated subnetworks that comprise well-known cancer signaling pathways as well as subnetworks with less characterized roles in cancer, including cohesin, condensin and others. Many of these subnetworks exhibit co-occurring mutations across samples. These subnetworks contain dozens of genes with rare somatic mutations across multiple cancers; many of these genes have additional evidence supporting a role in cancer. By illuminating these rare combinations of mutations, pan-cancer network analyses provide a roadmap to investigate new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities across cancer types.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Xiao</author><author>Dagliyan, Onur</author><author>Hahn, Klaus M.</author><author>Danuser, Gaudenz</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Asthagiri, Anand R.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Profiling cellular morphodynamics by spatiotemporal spectrum decomposition.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1006321</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Public Library of Science</publisher><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>30071020</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006321</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Ma et al. - PLoS computational biology - Profiling cellular morphodynamics by spatiotemporal spectrum decomposition.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006321</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30071020</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6091976</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cellular morphology and associated morphodynamics are widely used for qualitative and quantitative assessments of cell state. Here we implement a framework to profile cellular morphodynamics based on an adaptive decomposition of local cell boundary motion into instantaneous frequency spectra defined by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). Our approach revealed that spontaneously migrating cells with approximately homogeneous molecular makeup show remarkably consistent instantaneous frequency distributions, though they have markedly heterogeneous mobility. Distinctions in cell edge motion between these cells are captured predominantly by differences in the magnitude of the frequencies. We found that acute photo-inhibition of Vav2 guanine exchange factor, an activator of the Rho family of signaling proteins coordinating cell motility, produces significant shifts in the frequency distribution, but does not affect frequency magnitude. We therefore concluded that the frequency spectrum encodes the wiring of the molecular circuitry that regulates cell boundary movements, whereas the magnitude captures the activation level of the circuitry. We also used HHT spectra as multi-scale spatiotemporal features in statistical region merging to identify subcellular regions of distinct motion behavior. In line with our conclusion that different HHT spectra relate to different signaling regimes, we found that subcellular regions with different morphodynamics indeed exhibit distinct Rac1 activities. This algorithm thus can serve as an accurate and sensitive classifier of cellular morphodynamics to pinpoint spatial and temporal boundaries between signaling regimes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kitajima, Shunsuke</author><author>Asahina, Hajime</author><author>Chen, Ting</author><author>Guo, Sujuan</author><author>Quiceno, Laura Gutierrez</author><author>Cavanaugh, Jillian D.</author><author>Merlino, Ashley A.</author><author>Tange, Shoichiro</author><author>Terai, Hideki</author><author>Kim, Jong Wook</author><author>Wang, Xiaoen</author><author>Zhou, Shan</author><author>Xu, Man</author><author>Wang, Stephen</author><author>Zhu, Zehua</author><author>Thai, Tran C.</author><author>Takahashi, Chiaki</author><author>Wang, Yujin</author><author>Neve, Richard</author><author>Stinson, Susanna</author><author>Tamayo, Pablo</author><author>Watanabe, Hideo</author><author>Kirschmeier, Paul T</author><author>Wong, Kwok-Kin</author><author>Barbie, David A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Overcoming Resistance to Dual Innate Immune and MEK Inhibition Downstream of KRAS.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>439-452.e6</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>BET inhibitor</keyword><keyword>IL-6</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>MEK inhibitor</keyword><keyword>STK11/LKB1</keyword><keyword>TBK1 inhibitor</keyword><keyword>TP53</keyword><keyword>YAP1 signaling</keyword><keyword>innate immune signaling</keyword><keyword>non-small-cell lung cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30205046</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2018.08.009</electronic-resource-num><notes>[Hobbs, 2016]: targeting specific KRAS mutants

Combined downstream RAL-TBK1 and MEK inhibition induces only transient lung tumor shrinkage in KRAS-driven genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Using the sensitive KRAS;LKB1 (KL) mutant background, we identify YAP1 upregulation and a therapy-induced secretome as mediators of acquired resistance. This program is reversible, associated with H3K27 promoter acetylation, and suppressed by BET inhibition, resensitizing resistant KL cells to TBK1/MEK inhibition. Constitutive YAP1 signaling promotes intrinsic resistance in KRAS;TP53 (KP) mutant lung cancer. Intermittent treatment with the BET inhibitor JQ1 thus overcomes resistance to combined pathway inhibition in KL and KP GEMMs. Using potent and selective TBK1 and BET inhibitors we further develop an effective therapeutic strategy with potential translatability to the clinic.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Razavi, Pedram</author><author>Chang, Matthew T</author><author>Xu, Guotai</author><author>Bandlamudi, Chaitanya</author><author>Ross, Dara S</author><author>Vasan, Neil</author><author>Cai, Yanyan</author><author>Bielski, Craig M</author><author>Donoghue, Mark T A</author><author>Jonsson, Philip</author><author>Penson, Alexander</author><author>Shen, Ronglai</author><author>Pareja, Fresia</author><author>Kundra, Ritika</author><author>Middha, Sumit</author><author>Cheng, Michael L</author><author>Zehir, Ahmet</author><author>Kandoth, Cyriac</author><author>Patel, Ruchi</author><author>Huberman, Kety</author><author>Smyth, Lillian M</author><author>Jhaveri, Komal</author><author>Modi, Shanu</author><author>Traina, Tiffany A</author><author>Dang, Chau</author><author>Zhang, Wen</author><author>Weigelt, Britta</author><author>Li, Bob T</author><author>Ladanyi, Marc</author><author>Hyman, David M</author><author>Schultz, Nikolaus</author><author>Robson, Mark E</author><author>Hudis, Clifford</author><author>Brogi, Edi</author><author>Viale, Agnes</author><author>Norton, Larry</author><author>Dickler, Maura N</author><author>Berger, Michael F</author><author>Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine A</author><author>Chandarlapaty, Sarat</author><author>Scaltriti, Maurizio</author><author>Reis-Filho, Jorge S</author><author>Solit, David B</author><author>Taylor, Barry S</author><author>Baselga, José</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Genomic Landscape of Endocrine-Resistant Advanced Breast Cancers.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>427-438.e6</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>cancer genomics</keyword><keyword>endocrine resistance</keyword><keyword>integrative genomics analysis</keyword><keyword>metastasis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1878-3686 (Electronic) 1535-6108 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>30205045</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2018.08.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Razavi et al. - Cancer cell - The Genomic Landscape of Endocrine-Resistant Advanced Breast Cancers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2018.08.008</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30205045</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6327853</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We integrated the genomic sequencing of 1,918 breast cancers, including 1,501 hormone receptor-positive tumors, with detailed clinical information and treatment outcomes.

Activating ERBB2 mutations and NF1 loss-of-function mutations were more than twice as common in endocrine resistant tumors. Alterations in other MAPK pathway genes (EGFR, KRAS, among others) and estrogen receptor transcriptional regulators (MYC, CTCF, FOXA1, and TBX3) were also enriched. Altogether, these alterations were present in 22% of tumors, mutually exclusive with ESR1 mutations, and associated with a shorter duration of response to subsequent hormonal therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Archer, Tenley C</author><author>Ehrenberger, Tobias</author><author>Mundt, Filip</author><author>Gold, Maxwell P</author><author>Krug, Karsten</author><author>Mah, Clarence K</author><author>Mahoney, Elizabeth L</author><author>Daniel, Colin J</author><author>LeNail, Alexander</author><author>Ramamoorthy, Divya</author><author>Mertins, Philipp</author><author>Mani, D.

To address this challenge, we quantitatively profiled global proteomes and phospho-proteomes of 45 medulloblastoma samples. Integrated analyses revealed that tumors with similar RNA expression vary extensively at the post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. We identified distinct pathways associated with two subsets of SHH tumors, and found post-translational modifications of MYC that are associated with poor outcomes in group 3 tumors. We found kinases associated with subtypes and showed that inhibiting PRKDC sensitizes MYC-driven cells to radiation. Our study shows that proteomics enables a more comprehensive, functional readout, providing a foundation for future therapeutic strategies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gu, Yunyan</author><author>Yang, Da</author><author>Zou, Jinfeng</author><author>Ma, Wencai</author><author>Wu, Ruihong</author><author>Zhao, Wenyuan</author><author>Zhang, Yuannv</author><author>Xiao, Hui</author><author>Gong, Xue</author><author>Zhang, Min</author><author>Zhu, Jing</author><author>Guo, Zheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systematic interpretation of comutated genes in large-scale cancer mutation profiles.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cancer therapeutics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cancer therapeutics</full-title></periodical><pages>2186-95</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20663929</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0022</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Gu et al. - Molecular cancer therapeutics - Systematic interpretation of comutated genes in large-scale cancer mutation profiles.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.aacrjournals.org</url><url>http://mct.aacrjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0022</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663929</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>By high-throughput screens of somatic mutations of genes in cancer genomes, hundreds of cancer genes are being rapidly identified, providing us abundant information for systematically deciphering the genetic changes underlying cancer mechanism. However, the functional collaboration of mutated genes is often neglected in current studies. Here, using four genome-wide somatic mutation data sets and pathways defined in various databases, we showed that gene pairs significantly comutated in cancer samples tend to distribute between pathways rather than within pathways. At the basic functional level of motifs in the human protein-protein interaction network, we also found that comutated gene pairs were overrepresented between motifs but extremely depleted within motifs. Specifically, we showed that based on Gene Ontology that describes gene functions at various specific levels, we could tackle the pathway definition problem to some degree and study the functional collaboration of gene mutations in cancer genomes more efficiently. Then, by defining pairs of pathways frequently linked by comutated gene pairs as the between-pathway models, we showed they are also likely to be codisrupted by mutations of the interpathway hubs of the coupled pathways, suggesting new hints for understanding the heterogeneous mechanisms of cancers. Finally, we showed some between-pathway models consisting of important pathways such as cell cycle checkpoint and cell proliferation were codisrupted in most cancer samples under this study, suggesting that their codisruptions might be functionally essential in inducing these cancers. All together, our results would provide a channel to detangle the complex collaboration of the molecular processes underlying cancer mechanism.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Justin K.</author><author>Carlin, Daniel E.</author><author>Yu, Michael Ku</author><author>Zhang, Wei</author><author>Kreisberg, Jason F.</author><author>Tamayo, Pablo</author><author>Ideker, Trey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systematic Evaluation of Molecular Networks for Discovery of Disease Genes</title><secondary-title>Cell Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>484-495.e5</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>genome-wide disease association</keyword><keyword>molecular networks</keyword><keyword>network analysis</keyword><keyword>network propagation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>29605183</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>PathGuide is a website tracking the pathway repositories

Here, we evaluate 21 human genome-wide interaction networks for their ability to recover 446 disease gene sets identified through literature curation, gene expression profiling, or genome-wide association studies. While all networks have some ability to recover disease genes, we observe a wide range of performance with STRING, ConsensusPathDB, and GIANT networks having the best performance overall. A general tendency is that performance scales with network size, suggesting that new interaction discovery currently outweighs the detrimental effects of false positives. Correcting for size, we find that the DIP network provides the highest efficiency (value per interaction). Based on these results, we create a parsimonious composite network with both high efficiency and performance. This work provides a benchmark for selection of molecular networks in human disease research. We evaluate 21 human genome-wide interaction networks for their ability to recover 446 disease gene sets.

As of September 2016 (build 3.4.140), the BioGRID contains 1 072 173 genetic and protein interactions, and 38 559 post-translational modifications, as manually annotated from 48 114 publications. This dataset represents interaction records for 66 model organisms and represents a 30% increase compared to the previous 2015 BioGRID update. BioGRID curates the biomedical literature for major model organism species, including humans, with a recent emphasis on central biological processes and specific human diseases. To facilitate network-based approaches to drug discovery, BioGRID now incorporates 27 501 chemical-protein interactions for human drug targets, as drawn from the DrugBank database. A new dynamic interaction network viewer allows the easy navigation and filtering of all genetic and protein interaction data, as well as for bioactive compounds and their established targets. BioGRID data are directly downloadable without restriction in a variety of standardized formats and are freely distributed through partner model organism databases and meta-databases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, Peter A</author><author>Koehler, Michael F T</author><author>Girgis, Hany S</author><author>Yan, Donghong</author><author>Chen, Yongsheng</author><author>Chen, Yuan</author><author>Crawford, James J</author><author>Durk, Matthew R</author><author>Higuchi, Robert I</author><author>Kang, Jing</author><author>Murray, Jeremy</author><author>Paraselli, Prasuna</author><author>Park, Summer</author><author>Phung, Wilson</author><author>Quinn, John G</author><author>Roberts, Tucker C</author><author>Rougé, Lionel</author><author>Schwarz, Jacob B</author><author>Skippington, Elizabeth</author><author>Wai, John</author><author>Xu, Min</author><author>Yu, Zhiyong</author><author>Zhang, Hua</author><author>Tan, Man-Wah</author><author>Heise, Christopher E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimized arylomycins are a new class of Gram-negative antibiotics.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>189-194</pages><volume>561</volume><issue>7722</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1476-4687</isbn><accession-num>30209367</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41586-018-0483-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Smith et al. - Nature - Optimized arylomycins are a new class of Gram-negative antibiotics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0483-6</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30209367</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Multidrug-resistant bacteria are spreading at alarming rates, and despite extensive efforts no new class of antibiotic with activity against Gram-negative bacteria has been approved in over fifty years. Natural products and their derivatives have a key role in combating Gram-negative pathogens. Here we report chemical optimization of the arylomycins-a class of natural products with weak activity and limited spectrum-to obtain G0775, a molecule with potent, broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria. G0775 inhibits the essential bacterial type I signal peptidase, a new antibiotic target, through an unprecedented molecular mechanism. It circumvents existing antibiotic resistance mechanisms and retains activity against contemporary multidrug-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates in vitro and in several in vivo infection models. These findings demonstrate that optimized arylomycin analogues such as G0775 could translate into new therapies to address the growing threat of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Canfield, Scott G</author><author>Stebbins, Matthew J</author><author>Morales, Bethsymarie Soto</author><author>Asai, Shusaku W</author><author>Vatine, Gad D</author><author>Svendsen, Clive N</author><author>Palecek, Sean P</author><author>Shusta, Eric V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An isogenic blood-brain barrier model comprising brain endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.</title><secondary-title>Journal of neurochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of neurochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>874-888</pages><volume>140</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>astrocytes</keyword><keyword>blood-brain barrier model</keyword><keyword>neurons</keyword><keyword>neurovascular unit</keyword><keyword>stem cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>0000000154871</isbn><accession-num>27935037</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jnc.13923</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Camacho et al. - Cell - Next-Generation Machine Learning for Biological Networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.015</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27935037</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5339046</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is critical in maintaining a physical and metabolic barrier between the blood and the brain. The BBB consists of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) that line the brain vasculature and combine with astrocytes, neurons and pericytes to form the neurovascular unit. We hypothesized that astrocytes and neurons generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could induce BBB phenotypes in iPSC-derived BMECs, creating a robust multicellular human BBB model. To this end, iPSCs were used to form neural progenitor-like EZ-spheres, which were in turn differentiated to neurons and astrocytes, enabling facile neural cell generation. The iPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons induced barrier tightening in primary rat BMECs indicating their BBB inductive capacity. When co-cultured with human iPSC-derived BMECs, the iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes significantly elevated trans-endothelial electrical resistance, reduced passive permeability, and improved tight junction continuity in the BMEC cell population, while p-glycoprotein efflux transporter activity was unchanged. A physiologically relevant neural cell mixture of one neuron: three astrocytes yielded optimal BMEC induction properties. Finally, an isogenic multicellular BBB model was successfully demonstrated employing BMECs, astrocytes, and neurons from the same donor iPSC source. It is anticipated that such an isogenic facsimile of the human BBB could have applications in furthering understanding the cellular interplay of the neurovascular unit in both healthy and diseased humans.

Although most of these methods do not account for possibly different types of variables in the set of covariates available in the same dataset, there are many such scenarios where the variables can be structured in blocks of different types, e.g., clinical, transcriptomic, and methylation data. To date, there exist a few computationally intensive approaches that make use of block structures of this kind. RESULTS In this paper we present priority-Lasso, an intuitive and practical analysis strategy for building prediction models based on Lasso that takes such block structures into account. It requires the definition of a priority order of blocks of data. Lasso models are calculated successively for every block and the fitted values of every step are included as an offset in the fit of the next step. We apply priority-Lasso in different settings on an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) dataset consisting of clinical variables, cytogenetics, gene mutations and expression variables, and compare its performance on an independent validation dataset to the performance of standard Lasso models. CONCLUSION The results show that priority-Lasso is able to keep pace with Lasso in terms of prediction accuracy. Variables of blocks with higher priorities are favored over variables of blocks with lower priority, which results in easily usable and transportable models for clinical practice.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giacomelli, Andrew O</author><author>Yang, Xiaoping</author><author>Lintner, Robert E</author><author>McFarland, James M.</author><author>Duby, Marc</author><author>Kim, Jaegil</author><author>Howard, Thomas P</author><author>Takeda, David Y</author><author>Ly, Seav Huong</author><author>Kim, Eejung</author><author>Gannon, Hugh S</author><author>Hurhula, Brian</author><author>Sharpe, Ted</author><author>Goodale, Amy</author><author>Fritchman, Briana</author><author>Steelman, Scott</author><author>Vazquez, Francisca</author><author>Tsherniak, Aviad</author><author>Aguirre, Andrew J</author><author>Doench, John G</author><author>Piccioni, Federica</author><author>Roberts, Charles W M</author><author>Meyerson, Matthew</author><author>Getz, Gad</author><author>Johannessen, Cory M</author><author>Root, David E</author><author>Hahn, William C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutational processes shape the landscape of TP53 mutations in human cancer</title><secondary-title>Nature Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Computational biology and bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Genetic techniques</keyword><keyword>Genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41588-018-0204-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Giacomelli et al. - Nature Genetics - Mutational processes shape the landscape of TP53 mutations in human cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0204-y</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0204-y</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Unlike most tumor suppressor genes, the most common genetic alterations in tumor protein p53 (TP53) are missense mutations1,2. Mutant p53 protein is often abundantly expressed in cancers and specific allelic variants exhibit dominant-negative or gain-of-function activities in experimental models3–8. To gain a systematic view of p53 function, we interrogated loss-of-function screens conducted in hundreds of human cancer cell lines and performed TP53 saturation mutagenesis screens in an isogenic pair of TP53 wild-type and null cell lines. We found that loss or dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type p53 function reliably enhanced cellular fitness. By integrating these data with the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) mutational signatures database9,10, we developed a statistical model that describes the TP53 mutational spectrum as a function of the baseline probability of acquiring each mutation and the fitness advantage conferred by attenuation of p53 activity. Collectively, these observations show that widely-acting and tissue-specific mutational processes combine with phenotypic selection to dictate the frequencies of recurrent TP53 mutations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Akcakaya, Pinar</author><author>Bobbin, Maggie L</author><author>Guo, Jimmy A</author><author>Malagon-Lopez, Jose</author><author>Clement, Kendell</author><author>Garcia, Sara P</author><author>Fellows, Mick D</author><author>Porritt, Michelle J</author><author>Firth, Mike A</author><author>Carreras, Alba</author><author>Baccega, Tania</author><author>Seeliger, Frank</author><author>Bjursell, Mikael</author><author>Tsai, Shengdar Q</author><author>Nguyen, Nhu T</author><author>Nitsch, Roberto</author><author>Mayr, Lorenz M</author><author>Pinello, Luca</author><author>Bohlooly-Y, Mohammad</author><author>Aryee, Martin J</author><author>Maresca, Marcello</author><author>Joung, J Keith</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In vivo CRISPR editing with no detectable genome-wide off-target mutations.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30209390</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41586-018-0500-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Akcakaya et al. - Nature - In vivo CRISPR editing with no detectable genome-wide off-target mutations.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0500-9</url><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0500-9</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30209390</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>CRISPR-Cas genome-editing nucleases hold substantial promise for developing human therapeutic applications1-6 but identifying unwanted off-target mutations is important for clinical translation7. A well-validated method that can reliably identify off-targets in vivo has not been described to date, which means it is currently unclear whether and how frequently these mutations occur. Here we describe 'verification of in vivo off-targets' (VIVO), a highly sensitive strategy that can robustly identify the genome-wide off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas nucleases in vivo. We use VIVO and a guide RNA deliberately designed to be promiscuous to show that CRISPR-Cas nucleases can induce substantial off-target mutations in mouse livers in vivo. More importantly, we also use VIVO to show that appropriately designed guide RNAs can direct efficient in vivo editing in mouse livers with no detectable off-target mutations. VIVO provides a general strategy for defining and quantifying the off-target effects of gene-editing nucleases in whole organisms, thereby providing a blueprint to foster the development of therapeutic strategies that use in vivo gene editing.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Temko, Daniel</author><author>Tomlinson, Ian P M</author><author>Severini, Simone</author><author>Schuster-Böckler, Benjamin</author><author>Graham, Trevor A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of mutational processes and selection on driver mutations across cancer types.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1857</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29748584</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-018-04208-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Temko et al. - Nature communications - The effects of mutational processes and selection on driver mutations across cancer types.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/naturecommunications</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29748584</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5945620</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>Epidemiological evidence has long associated environmental mutagens with increased cancer risk. However, links between specific mutation-causing processes and the acquisition of individual driver mutations have remained obscure. Here we have used public cancer sequencing data from 11,336 cancers of various types to infer the independent effects of mutation and selection on the set of driver mutations in a cancer type. First, we detect associations between a range of mutational processes, including those linked to smoking, ageing, APOBEC and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and the presence of key driver mutations across cancer types. Second, we quantify differential selection between well-known alternative driver mutations, including differences in selection between distinct mutant residues in the same gene. These results show that while mutational processes have a large role in determining which driver mutations are present in a cancer, the role of selection frequently dominates.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Palin, Kimmo</author><author>Pitkänen, Esa</author><author>Turunen, Mikko</author><author>Sahu, Biswajyoti</author><author>Pihlajamaa, Päivi</author><author>Kivioja, Teemu</author><author>Kaasinen, Eevi</author><author>Välimäki, Niko</author><author>Hänninen, Ulrika A</author><author>Cajuso, Tatiana</author><author>Aavikko, Mervi</author><author>Tuupanen, Sari</author><author>Kilpivaara, Outi</author><author>van den Berg, Linda</author><author>Kondelin, Johanna</author><author>Tanskanen, Tomas</author><author>Katainen, Riku</author><author>Grau, Marta</author><author>Rauanheimo, Heli</author><author>Plaketti, Roosa-Maria</author><author>Taira, Aurora</author><author>Sulo, Päivi</author><author>Hartonen, Tuomo</author><author>Dave, Kashyap</author><author>Schmierer, Bernhard</author><author>Botla, Sandeep</author><author>Sokolova, Maria</author><author>Vähärautio, Anna</author><author>Gladysz, Kornelia</author><author>Ongen, Halit</author><author>Dermitzakis, Emmanouil</author><author>Bramsen, Jesper Bertram</author><author>Ørntoft, Torben Falck</author><author>Andersen, Claus Lindbjerg</author><author>Ristimäki, Ari</author><author>Lepistö, Anna</author><author>Renkonen-Sinisalo, Laura</author><author>Mecklin, Jukka-Pekka</author><author>Taipale, Jussi</author><author>Aaltonen, Lauri A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contribution of allelic imbalance to colorectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>3664</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer genetics</keyword><keyword>Cancer genomics</keyword><keyword>Colorectal cancer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30202008</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-018-06132-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Palin et al. - Nature communications - Contribution of allelic imbalance to colorectal cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/naturecommunications</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06132-1</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202008</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Point mutations in cancer have been extensively studied but chromosomal gains and losses have been more challenging to interpret due to their unspecific nature. Here we examine high-resolution allelic imbalance (AI) landscape in 1699 colorectal cancers, 256 of which have been whole-genome sequenced (WGSed). The imbalances pinpoint 38 genes as plausible AI targets based on previous knowledge. Unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and activation screens identified in total 79 genes within AI peaks regulating cell growth. Genetic and functional data implicate loss of TP53 as a sufficient driver of AI. The WGS highlights an influence of copy number aberrations on the rate of detected somatic point mutations. Importantly, the data reveal several associations between AI target genes, suggesting a role for a network of lineage-determining transcription factors in colorectal tumorigenesis. Overall, the results unravel the contribution of AI in colorectal cancer and provide a plausible explanation why so few genes are commonly affected by point mutations in cancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Le Morvan, Marine</author><author>Zinovyev, Andrei</author><author>Vert, Jean Philippe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NetNorM: Capturing cancer-relevant information in somatic exome mutation data with gene networks for cancer stratification and prognosis</title><secondary-title>PLoS Computational Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS Computational Biology</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>0923-8174</isbn><accession-num>28650955</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005573</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Le Morvan, Zinovyev, Vert - PLoS Computational Biology - NetNorM Capturing cancer-relevant information in somatic exome mutation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005573</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>We have studied the feasibility of designing a second-order band-pass filter which can provide itself information about its central frequency when it is led to an specific operation mode (calibration mode). The filter has been built with discrete components around a TL071 Operational Amplifier. When a control digital signal toggles the calibration mode, the filter components are reconfigured into an oscillator thanks to some analog switches. The oscillation frequency allows predicting the filter central frequency with an rms error of 0.33%. Since there are many possibilities to reconfigure the filter into an oscillator and the choice of the best test-mode oscillator in terms of predictability demands a great deal of computational effort, we have found out a simple criterion for choosing the best scheme avoiding that effort. This criterion takes into account the sensitivities of the performance parameters (the central frequency) and the test observables (the oscillation frequency) with respect to the passive and active components of the filter. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hammond, Dean E</author><author>Mageean, Craig J</author><author>Rusilowicz, Emma V</author><author>Wickenden, Julie A</author><author>Clague, Michael J</author><author>Prior, Ian A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential reprogramming of isogenic colorectal cancer cells by distinct activating KRAS mutations.</title><secondary-title>Journal of proteome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of proteome research</full-title></periodical><pages>1535-46</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Ras</keyword><keyword>SILAC phosphoproteomics</keyword><keyword>colorectal cancer</keyword><keyword>isogenic cells</keyword><keyword>signaling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1535-3907 (Electronic)\r1535-3893 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>25599653</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/pr501191a</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Hammond et al. - Journal of proteome research - Differential reprogramming of isogenic colorectal cancer cells by distinct activa.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.tm4.org/mev</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599653</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4356034</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Oncogenic mutations of Ras at codons 12, 13, or 61, that render the protein constitutively active, are found in ∼ 16% of all cancer cases. Among the three major Ras isoforms, KRAS is the most frequently mutated isoform in cancer. Each Ras isoform and tumor type displays a distinct pattern of codon-specific mutations. In colon cancer, KRAS is typically mutated at codon 12, but a significant fraction of patients have mutations at codon 13. Clinical data suggest different outcomes and responsiveness to treatment between these two groups. To investigate the differential effects upon cell status associated with KRAS mutations we performed a quantitative analysis of the proteome and phosphoproteome of isogenic SW48 colon cancer cell lines in which one allele of the endogenous gene has been edited to harbor specific KRAS mutations (G12V, G12D, or G13D). Each mutation generates a distinct signature, with the most variability seen between G13D and the codon 12 KRAS mutants. One notable example of specific up-regulation in KRAS codon 12 mutant SW48 cells is provided by the short form of the colon cancer stem cell marker doublecortin-like Kinase 1 (DCLK1) that can be reversed by suppression of KRAS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Newspaper Article">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, Antoine</author><author>Martignetti, Loredana</author><author>Puget, Stéphanie</author><author>Calzone, Laurence</author><author>Brabetz, Sebastian</author><author>Picard, Daniel</author><author>Montagud, Arnau</author><author>Liva, Stéphane</author><author>Sta, Alexandre</author><author>Dingli, Florent</author><author>Arras, Guillaume</author><author>Rivera, Jaime</author><author>Loew, Damarys</author><author>Besnard, Aurore</author><author>Lacombe, Joëlle</author><author>Pagès, Mélanie</author><author>Varlet, Pascale</author><author>Dufour, Christelle</author><author>Yu, Hua</author><author>Mercier, Audrey L.</author><author>Indersie, Emilie</author><author>Chivet, Anaïs</author><author>Leboucher, Sophie</author><author>Sieber, Laura</author><author>Beccaria, Kevin</author><author>Gombert, Michael</author><author>Meyer, Frauke D.</author><author>Qin, Nan</author><author>Bartl, Jasmin</author><author>Chavez, Lukas</author><author>Okonechnikov, Konstantin</author><author>Sharma, Tanvi</author><author>Thatikonda, Venu</author><author>Bourdeaut, Franck</author><author>Pouponnot, Celio</author><author>Ramaswamy, Vijay</author><author>Korshunov, Andrey</author><author>Borkhardt, Arndt</author><author>Reifenberger, Guido</author><author>Poullet, Patrick</author><author>Taylor, Michael D.</author><author>Kool, Marcel</author><author>Pfister, Stefan M.</author><author>Kawauchi, Daisuke</author><author>Barillot, Emmanuel</author><author>Remke, Marc</author><author>Ayrault, Olivier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aberrant ERBB4-SRC Signaling as a Hallmark of Group 4 Medulloblastoma Revealed by Integrative Phosphoproteomic Profiling</title><secondary-title>Cancer Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>379-395.e7</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>medulloblastoma</keyword><keyword>multi-omics</keyword><keyword>proteomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2018.08.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>[Cavalli et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014]: similarity network fusion (SNF) to integrate all proteogenomic data

While medulloblastoma subgroups have been characterized extensively at the (epi-)genomic and transcriptomic levels, the proteome and phosphoproteome landscape remain to be comprehensively elucidated. Using quantitative (phospho)-proteomics in primary human medulloblastomas, we unravel distinct posttranscriptional regulation leading to highly divergent oncogenic signaling and kinase activity profiles in groups 3 and 4 medulloblastomas. Specifically, proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses identify aberrant ERBB4-SRC signaling in group 4. Hence, enforced expression of an activated SRC combined with p53 inactivation induces murine tumors that resemble group 4 medulloblastoma. Therefore, our integrative proteogenomics approach unveils an oncogenic pathway and potential therapeutic vulnerability in the most common medulloblastoma subgroup. Using proteomic analyses, Forget et al. unravel divergent oncogenic signaling and kinase activity profiles in groups 3 and 4 medulloblastomas (MB) and identify aberrant ERBB4-SRC signaling in group 4. Expression of an activated SRC combined with p53 inactivation induces murine tumors that resemble group 4 MB.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frost, H Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computation and application of tissue-specific gene set weights.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><issue>April</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29659714</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bty217</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Frost - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Computation and application of tissue-specific gene set weights.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp.</url><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty217/4962491</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29659714</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation Gene set testing, or pathway analysis, has become a critical tool for the analysis of highdimensional genomic data. Although the function and activity of many genes and higher-level processes is tissue-specific, gene set testing is typically performed in a tissue agnostic fashion, which impacts statistical power and the interpretation and replication of results. Results To address this challenge, we have developed a bioinformatics approach to compute tissuespecific weights for individual gene sets using information on tissue-specific gene activity from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). We used this approach to create a public repository of tissue-specific gene set weights for 37 different human tissue types from the HPA and all collections in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). To demonstrate the validity and utility of these weights, we explored three different applications: the functional characterization of human tissues, multi-tissue analysis for systemic diseases and tissue-specific gene set testing. Availability and Implementation All data used in the reported analyses is publicly available. An R implementation of the method and tissue-specific weights for MSigDB gene set collections can be downloaded at http://www.dartmouth.edu/∼hrfrost/TissueSpecificGeneSets.

Fortunately, many have substructures that occur often (“motifs”). A societal example of a motif might be a household. Replacing such motifs by named supernodes reduces the complexity of the network and can bring out insightful features. Doing so repeatedly may give hints about higher level structures of the network. We call this recursive process Recursive Supernode Extraction. This paper describes algorithms and a tool to discover disjoint (i.e. non-overlapping) motifs in a network, replacing those motifs by new nodes, and then recursing. We show applications in food-web and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks where our methods reduce the complexity of the network and yield insights. SuperNoder is a web-based and standalone tool which enables the simplification of big graphs based on the reduction of high frequency motifs. It applies various strategies for identifying disjoint motifs with the goal of enhancing the understandability of networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goya, Jonathan</author><author>Wong, Aaron K</author><author>Yao, Victoria</author><author>Krishnan, Arjun</author><author>Homilius, Max</author><author>Troyanskaya, Olga G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FNTM: a server for predicting functional networks of tissues in mouse.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>W182-7</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>W1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1362-4962 (Electronic)\r0305-1048 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>25940632</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkv443</electronic-resource-num><notes>[8] tissue specifcity of Ras</notes><research-notes>[8] tissue specifcity of Ras</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Goya et al. - Nucleic acids research - FNTM a server for predicting functional networks of tissues in mouse.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://fntm.princeton.edu.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25940632</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4489275</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:tissuespec</label><abstract>Functional Networks of Tissues in Mouse (FNTM) provides biomedical researchers with tissue-specific predictions of functional relationships between proteins in the most widely used model organism for human disease, the laboratory mouse.

Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Greene, Casey S</author><author>Krishnan, Arjun</author><author>Wong, Aaron K</author><author>Ricciotti, Emanuela</author><author>Zelaya, Rene A</author><author>Himmelstein, Daniel S</author><author>Zhang, Ran</author><author>Hartmann, Boris M</author><author>Zaslavsky, Elena</author><author>Sealfon, Stuart C</author><author>Chasman, Daniel I</author><author>FitzGerald, Garret A</author><author>Dolinski, Kara</author><author>Grosser, Tilo</author><author>Troyanskaya, Olga G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Understanding multicellular function and disease with human tissue-specific networks.</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>569-76</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0304-3797\r1469-5898</isbn><accession-num>25915600</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng.3259</electronic-resource-num><notes>GIANT has essentailly moved to another repo called HumanBase</notes><research-notes>GIANT has essentailly moved to another repo called HumanBase</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Greene et al. - Nature genetics - Understanding multicellular function and disease with human tissue-specific networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3259.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25915600</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4828725</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Tissue and cell-type identity lie at the core of human physiology and disease.

We present genome-wide functional interaction networks for 144 human tissues and cell types developed using a data-driven Bayesian methodology that integrates thousands of diverse experiments spanning tissue and disease states. Tissue-specific networks predict lineage-specific responses to perturbation, identify the changing functional roles of genes across tissues and illuminate relationships among diseases. We introduce NetWAS, which combines genes with nominally significant genome-wide association study (GWAS) P values and tissue-specific networks to identify disease-gene associations more accurately than GWAS alone. Our webserver, GIANT, provides an interface to human tissue networks through multi-gene queries, network visualization, analysis tools including NetWAS and downloadable networks. GIANT enables systematic exploration of the landscape of interacting genes that shape specialized cellular functions across more than a hundred human tissues and cell types.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Lei</author><author>Li, Fuhai</author><author>Sheng, Jianting</author><author>Xia, Xiaofeng</author><author>Ma, Jinwen</author><author>Zhan, Ming</author><author>Wong, Stephen T C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DrugComboRanker: drug combination discovery based on target network analysis.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>i228-36</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Contact</keyword><keyword>stwong@tmhsorg</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1367-4811</isbn><accession-num>24931988</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btu278</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Huang et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - DrugComboRanker drug combination discovery based on target network analysis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4058933/pdf/btu278.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24931988</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4058933</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION Currently there are no curative anticancer drugs, and drug resistance is often acquired after drug treatment. One of the reasons is that cancers are complex diseases, regulated by multiple signaling pathways and cross talks among the pathways. It is expected that drug combinations can reduce drug resistance and improve patients' outcomes. In clinical practice, the ideal and feasible drug combinations are combinations of existing Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs or bioactive compounds that are already used on patients or have entered clinical trials and passed safety tests. These drug combinations could directly be used on patients with less concern of toxic effects. However, there is so far no effective computational approach to search effective drug combinations from the enormous number of possibilities. RESULTS In this study, we propose a novel systematic computational tool DRUGCOMBORANKER: to prioritize synergistic drug combinations and uncover their mechanisms of action. We first build a drug functional network based on their genomic profiles, and partition the network into numerous drug network communities by using a Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization approach. As drugs within overlapping community share common mechanisms of action, we next uncover potential targets of drugs by applying a recommendation system on drug communities. We meanwhile build disease-specific signaling networks based on patients' genomic profiles and interactome data. We then identify drug combinations by searching drugs whose targets are enriched in the complementary signaling modules of the disease signaling network. The novel method was evaluated on lung adenocarcinoma and endocrine receptor positive breast cancer, and compared with other drug combination approaches. These case studies discovered a set of effective drug combinations top ranked in our prediction list, and mapped the drug targets on the disease signaling network to highlight the mechanisms of action of the drug combinations.

Somatic tumor genome sequences provide a rich new source of data for uncovering these subtypes but have proven difficult to compare, as two tumors rarely share the same mutations. Here we introduce network-based stratification (NBS), a method to integrate somatic tumor genomes with gene networks. This approach allows for stratification of cancer into informative subtypes by clustering together patients with mutations in similar network regions. We demonstrate NBS in ovarian, uterine and lung cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas. For each tissue, NBS identifies subtypes that are predictive of clinical outcomes such as patient survival, response to therapy or tumor histology. We identify network regions characteristic of each subtype and show how mutation-derived subtypes can be used to train an mRNA expression signature, which provides similar information in the absence of DNA sequence.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, Tianwei</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Ioshikhes, Ilya</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>A new dynamic correlation algorithm reveals novel functional aspects in single cell and bulk RNA-seq data.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1006391</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Public Library of Science</publisher><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>30080856</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006391</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Yu - PLoS computational biology - A new dynamic correlation algorithm reveals novel functional aspects in single cell and bulk RN.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006391</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30080856</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6095616</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Dynamic correlations are pervasive in high-throughput data. Large numbers of gene pairs can change their correlation patterns in response to observed/unobserved changes in physiological states. Finding changes in correlation patterns can reveal important regulatory mechanisms. Currently there is no method that can effectively detect global dynamic correlation patterns in a dataset. Given the challenging nature of the problem, the currently available methods use genes as surrogate measurements of physiological states, which cannot faithfully represent true underlying biological signals. In this study we develop a new method that directly identifies strong latent dynamic correlation signals from the data matrix, named DCA: Dynamic Correlation Analysis. At the center of the method is a new metric for the identification of pairs of variables that are highly likely to be dynamically correlated, without knowing the underlying physiological states that govern the dynamic correlation. We validate the performance of the method with extensive simulations. We applied the method to three real datasets: a single cell RNA-seq dataset, a bulk RNA-seq dataset, and a microarray gene expression dataset. In all three datasets, the method reveals novel latent factors with clear biological meaning, bringing new insights into the data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kahles, André</author><author>Lehmann, Kjong-Van</author><author>Toussaint, Nora C</author><author>Hüser, Matthias</author><author>Stark, Stefan G</author><author>Sachsenberg, Timo</author><author>Stegle, Oliver</author><author>Kohlbacher, Oliver</author><author>Sander, Chris</author><author>Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network</author><author>Rätsch, Gunnar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comprehensive Analysis of Alternative Splicing Across Tumors from 8,705 Patients.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>211-224.e6</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>CPTAC</keyword><keyword>GTEx</keyword><keyword>MS proteomics</keyword><keyword>RNA-seq</keyword><keyword>TCGA</keyword><keyword>TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas</keyword><keyword>alternative splicing</keyword><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>exome</keyword><keyword>immunoediting</keyword><keyword>immunotherapy</keyword><keyword>neoantigens</keyword><keyword>splicing QTL</keyword><keyword>tumor-specific splicing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30078747</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2018.07.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Kahles et al. - Cancer cell - Comprehensive Analysis of Alternative Splicing Across Tumors from 8,705 Patients.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2018.03.004</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29657127</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27107533</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078747</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Our comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing across 32 The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer types from 8,705 patients detects alternative splicing events and tumor variants by reanalyzing RNA and whole-exome sequencing data.

Combining these structured information sources is an important computational challenge, as large graphs are difficult to analyze visually. Results: We investigate knowledge discovery in manually curated and annotated molecular interaction diagrams. To evaluate similarity of content we use: i) Euclidean distance in expert-drawn diagrams, ii) shortest path distance using the underlying network and iii) ontology-based distance. We employ clustering with these metrics used separately and in pairwise combinations. We propose a novel bi-level optimization approach together with an evolutionary algorithm for informative combination of distance metrics. We compare the enrichment of the obtained clusters between the solutions and with expert knowledge. We calculate the number of Gene and Disease Ontology terms discovered by different solutions as a measure of cluster quality. Our results show that combining distance metrics can improve clustering accuracy, based on the comparison with expert-provided clusters. Also, the performance of specific combinations of distance functions depends on the clustering depth (number of clusters). By employing bi-level optimization approach we evaluated relative importance of distance functions and we found that indeed the order by which they are combined affects clustering performance. Next, with the enrichment analysis of clustering results we found that both hierarchical and bi-level clustering schemes discovered more Gene and Disease Ontology terms than expert-provided clusters for the same knowledge repository. Moreover, bi-level clustering found more enriched terms than the best hierarchical clustering solution for three distinct distance metric combinations in three different instances of disease maps. Conclusions: In this work we examined the impact of different distance functions on clustering of a visual biomedical knowledge repository. We found that combining distance functions may be beneficial for clustering, and improve exploration of such repositories. We proposed bi-level optimization to evaluate the importance of order by which the distance functions are combined. Both combination and order of these functions affected clustering quality and knowledge recognition in the considered benchmarks. We propose that multiple dimensions can be utilized simultaneously for visual knowledge exploration.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wendl, Michael C</author><author>Wallis, John W</author><author>Lin, Ling</author><author>Kandoth, Cyriac</author><author>Mardis, Elaine R</author><author>Wilson, Richard K</author><author>Ding, Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PathScan: a tool for discerning mutational significance in groups of putative cancer genes.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>1595-602</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1367-4811 (Electronic)\r1367-4803 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21498403</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btr193</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Wendl et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - PathScan a tool for discerning mutational significance in groups of putative ca.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://genome.wustl.edu/software/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21498403</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3106187</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION The expansion of cancer genome sequencing continues to stimulate development of analytical tools for inferring relationships between somatic changes and tumor development. Pathway associations are especially consequential, but existing algorithms are demonstrably inadequate. METHODS Here, we propose the PathScan significance test for the scenario where pathway mutations collectively contribute to tumor development. Its design addresses two aspects that established methods neglect. First, we account for variations in gene length and the consequent differences in their mutation probabilities under the standard null hypothesis of random mutation. The associated spike in computational effort is mitigated by accurate convolution-based approximation. Second, we combine individual probabilities into a multiple-sample value using Fisher-Lancaster theory, thereby improving differentiation between a few highly mutated genes and many genes having only a few mutations apiece. We investigate accuracy, computational effort and power, reporting acceptable performance for each. RESULTS As an example calculation, we re-analyze KEGG-based lung adenocarcinoma pathway mutations from the Tumor Sequencing Project. Our test recapitulates the most significant pathways and finds that others for which the original test battery was inconclusive are not actually significant. It also identifies the focal adhesion pathway as being significantly mutated, a finding consistent with earlier studies. We also expand this analysis to other databases: Reactome, BioCarta, Pfam, PID and SMART, finding additional hits in ErbB and EPHA signaling pathways and regulation of telomerase. All have implications and plausible mechanistic roles in cancer. Finally, we discuss aspects of extending the method to integrate gene-specific background rates and other types of genetic anomalies.

Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) offers a powerful approach to estimating changes in a kinase's activity based on the collective phosphorylation changes of its identified substrates. However, KSEA has been limited to programmers who are able to implement the algorithms. Thus, to make it accessible to the larger scientific community, we present a web-based application of this method: the KSEA App. Overall, we expect that this tool will offer a quick and user-friendly way of generating kinase activity estimates from high-throughput phosphoproteomics datasets. Availability and Implementation the KSEA App is a free online tool: casecpb.shinyapps.io/ksea/. The source code is on GitHub: github.com/casecpb/KSEA/.

Incidence strongly varies globally and is closely linked to elements of a so-called western lifestyle. Incidence is higher in men than women and strongly increases with age; median age at diagnosis is about 70 years in developed countries. Despite strong hereditary components, most cases of colorectal cancer are sporadic and develop slowly over several years through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The cornerstones of therapy are surgery, neoadjuvant radiotherapy (for patients with rectal cancer), and adjuvant chemotherapy (for patients with stage III/IV and high-risk stage II colon cancer). 5-year relative survival ranges from greater than 90% in patients with stage I disease to slightly greater than 10% in patients with stage IV disease. Screening has been shown to reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, but organised screening programmes are still to be implemented in most countries.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoyos, Luisa Escobar</author><author>Abdel-Wahab, Omar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cancer-Specific Splicing Changes and the Potential for Splicing-Derived Neoantigens.</title><secondary-title>Cancer cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer cell</full-title></periodical><pages>181-183</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30107172</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ccell.2018.07.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Hoyos, Abdel-Wahab - Cancer cell - Cancer-Specific Splicing Changes and the Potential for Splicing-Derived Neoantigens.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2018.07.010</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1535610818303167</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30107172</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this issue of Cancer Cell, Kahles et al. perform a comprehensive analysis of RNA splicing across cancer types and identify novel correlations between genetic alterations and splicing in cancer.

Screening, used to identify individuals at an early stage, has improved outcome. There is greater understanding of the genetic basis of inherited colorectal cancer and identification of patients at risk. Optimisation of surgery for patients with localised disease has had a major effect on survival at 5 years and 10 years. For rectal cancer, identification of patients at greatest risk of local failure is important in the selection of patients for preoperative chemoradiation, a strategy proven to improve outcomes in these patients. Stringent postoperative follow-up helps the early identification of potentially radically treatable oligometastatic disease and improves long-term survival. Treatment with adjuvant fluoropyrimidine for colon and rectal cancers further improves survival, more so in stage III than in stage II disease, and oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy is now routinely used for stage III disease, although efficacy must be carefully balanced against toxicity. In stage II disease, molecular markers such as microsatellite instability might help select patients for treatment. The integration of targeted treatments with conventional cytotoxic drugs has expanded the treatment of metastatic disease resulting in incremental survival gains. However, biomarker development is essential to aid selection of patients likely to respond to therapy, thereby rationalising treatments and improving outcomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tariq, Kanwal</author><author>Ghias, Kulsoom</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Colorectal cancer carcinogenesis: a review of mechanisms.</title><secondary-title>Cancer biology &amp; medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer biology &amp; medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>120-35</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Colorectal cancer</keyword><keyword>chromosomal instability</keyword><keyword>microsatellite instability</keyword><keyword>non-coding RNA mismatch repair</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1070-9878</isbn><accession-num>27144067</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.28092/j.issn.2095-3941.2015.0103</electronic-resource-num><notes>Good summary of pathway mutations associated with KRAS</notes><research-notes>Good summary of pathway mutations associated with KRAS</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Tariq, Ghias - Cancer biology &amp; medicine - Colorectal cancer carcinogenesis a review of mechanisms.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.cancerbiomed.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27144067%5Cnhttp://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4850121</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27144067</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4850121</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in women and the third most common in men globally. CRC arises from one or a combination of chromosomal instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite instability. Genetic instability is usually caused by aneuploidy and loss of heterozygosity. Mutations in the tumor suppressor or cell cycle genes may also lead to cellular transformation. Similarly, epigenetic and/or genetic alterations resulting in impaired cellular pathways, such as DNA repair mechanism, may lead to microsatellite instability and mutator phenotype. Non-coding RNAs, more importantly microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs have also been implicated at various CRC stages. Understanding the specific mechanisms of tumorigenesis and the underlying genetic and epigenetic traits is critical in comprehending the disease phenotype. This paper reviews these mechanisms along with the roles of various non-coding RNAs in CRCs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lachmann, Alexander</author><author>Ma'ayan, Avi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KEA: kinase enrichment analysis.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>684-6</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>1367-4811 (Electronic)\n1367-4803 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>19176546</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btp026</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Lachmann, Ma'ayan - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - KEA kinase enrichment analysis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://amp.pharm.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19176546</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2647829</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:tissuespec</label><abstract>MOTIVATION Multivariate experiments applied to mammalian cells often produce lists of proteins/genes altered under treatment versus control conditions. Such lists can be projected onto prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions to infer the list of kinases associated with a specific protein list. By computing how the proportion of kinases, associated with a specific list of proteins/genes, deviates from an expected distribution, we can rank kinases and kinase families based on the likelihood that these kinases are functionally associated with regulating the cell under specific experimental conditions. Such analysis can assist in producing hypotheses that can explain how the kinome is involved in the maintenance of different cellular states and can be manipulated to modulate cells towards a desired phenotype. SUMMARY Kinase enrichment analysis (KEA) is a web-based tool with an underlying database providing users with the ability to link lists of mammalian proteins/genes with the kinases that phosphorylate them. The system draws from several available kinase-substrate databases to compute kinase enrichment probability based on the distribution of kinase-substrate proportions in the background kinase-substrate database compared with kinases found to be associated with an input list of genes/proteins.

Owing to an increasing number of in vivo phosphorylation sites that have been identified by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the RegPhos, available online at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/RegPhos2/, was developed to explore protein phosphorylation networks in human. In this update, we not only enhance the data content in human but also investigate kinase-substrate phosphorylation networks in mouse and rat. The experimentally validated phosphorylation sites as well as their catalytic kinases were extracted from public resources, and MS/MS phosphopeptides were manually curated from research articles. RegPhos 2.0 aims to provide a more comprehensive view of intracellular signaling networks by integrating the information of metabolic pathways and protein-protein interactions. A case study shows that analyzing the phosphoproteome profile of time-dependent cell activation obtained from Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the RegPhos deciphered not only the consistent scheme in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway but also novel regulatory molecules that may involve in it. With an attempt to help users efficiently identify the candidate biomarkers in cancers, 30 microarray experiments, including 39 cancerous versus normal cells, were analyzed for detecting cancer-specific expressed genes coding for kinases and their substrates. Furthermore, this update features an improved web interface to facilitate convenient access to the exploration of phosphorylation networks for a group of genes/proteins.

We performed exome sequencing and copy number analysis to define genomic aberrations in a prospectively accrued clinical cohort (n = 142) of early (stage I and II) sporadic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Detailed analysis of 99 informative tumours identified substantial heterogeneity with 2,016 non-silent mutations and 1,628 copy-number variations. We define 16 significantly mutated genes, reaffirming known mutations (KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, MLL3, TGFBR2, ARID1A and SF3B1), and uncover novel mutated genes including additional genes involved in chromatin modification (EPC1 and ARID2), DNA damage repair (ATM) and other mechanisms (ZIM2, MAP2K4, NALCN, SLC16A4 and MAGEA6). Integrative analysis with in vitro functional data and animal models provided supportive evidence for potential roles for these genetic aberrations in carcinogenesis. Pathway-based analysis of recurrently mutated genes recapitulated clustering in core signalling pathways in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and identified new mutated genes in each pathway. We also identified frequent and diverse somatic aberrations in genes described traditionally as embryonic regulators of axon guidance, particularly SLIT/ROBO signalling, which was also evident in murine Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated somatic mutagenesis models of pancreatic cancer, providing further supportive evidence for the potential involvement of axon guidance genes in pancreatic carcinogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jang, Yeongjun</author><author>Yu, Namhee</author><author>Seo, Jihae</author><author>Kim, Sun</author><author>Lee, Sanghyuk</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MONGKIE: an integrated tool for network analysis and visualization for multi-omics data.</title><secondary-title>Biology direct</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biology direct</full-title></periodical><pages>10</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Graph clustering</keyword><keyword>Network modeling</keyword><keyword>Network visualization</keyword><keyword>Omics data analysis</keyword><keyword>Over-representation analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26987515</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13062-016-0112-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Jang et al. - Biology direct - MONGKIE an integrated tool for network analysis and visualization for multi-omics data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13062-016-0112-y</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26987515</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4797132</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Network-based integrative analysis is a powerful technique for extracting biological insights from multilayered omics data such as somatic mutations, copy number variations, and gene expression data. However, integrated analysis of multi-omics data is quite complicated and can hardly be done in an automated way. Thus, a powerful interactive visual mining tool supporting diverse analysis algorithms for identification of driver genes and regulatory modules is much needed. RESULTS Here, we present a software platform that integrates network visualization with omics data analysis tools seamlessly. The visualization unit supports various options for displaying multi-omics data as well as unique network models for describing sophisticated biological networks such as complex biomolecular reactions. In addition, we implemented diverse in-house algorithms for network analysis including network clustering and over-representation analysis. Novel functions include facile definition and optimized visualization of subgroups, comparison of a series of data sets in an identical network by data-to-visual mapping and subsequent overlaying function, and management of custom interaction networks. Utility of MONGKIE for network-based visual data mining of multi-omics data was demonstrated by analysis of the TCGA glioblastoma data. MONGKIE was developed in Java based on the NetBeans plugin architecture, thus being OS-independent with intrinsic support of module extension by third-party developers. CONCLUSION We believe that MONGKIE would be a valuable addition to network analysis software by supporting many unique features and visualization options, especially for analysing multi-omics data sets in cancer and other diseases. .</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Palaniappan, Ashok</author><author>Ramar, Karthick</author><author>Ramalingam, Satish</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computational Identification of Novel Stage-Specific Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer Progression.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0156665</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27243824</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0156665</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Palaniappan, Ramar, Ramalingam - PloS one - Computational Identification of Novel Stage-Specific Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156665&amp;type=printable</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27243824</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4887059</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>It is well-known that the conversion of normal colon epithelium to adenoma and then to carcinoma stems from acquired molecular changes in the genome. The genetic basis of colorectal cancer has been elucidated to a certain extent, and much remains to be known about the identity of specific cancer genes that are associated with the advancement of colorectal cancer from one stage to the next. Here in this study we attempted to identify novel cancer genes that could underlie the stage-specific progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer. We conducted a stage-based meta-analysis of the voluminous tumor genome-sequencing data and mined using multiple approaches for novel genes driving the progression to stage-II, stage-III and stage-IV colorectal cancer. The consensus of these driver genes seeded the construction of stage-specific networks, which were then analyzed for the centrality of genes, clustering of subnetworks, and enrichment of gene-ontology processes. Our study identified three novel driver genes as hubs for stage-II progression: DYNC1H1, GRIN2A, GRM1. Four novel driver genes were identified as hubs for stage-III progression: IGF1R, CPS1, SPTA1, DSP. Three novel driver genes were identified as hubs for stage-IV progression: GSK3B, GGT1, EIF2B5. We also identified several non-driver genes that appeared to underscore the progression of colorectal cancer. Our study yielded potential diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer as well as novel stage-specific drug targets for rational intervention. Our methodology is extendable to the analysis of other types of cancer to fill the gaps in our knowledge.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dimitrakopoulos, Christos M.</author><author>Beerenwinkel, Niko</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computational approaches for the identification of cancer genes and pathways.</title><secondary-title>Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

Cancer genomics research aims at identifying all cancer-related genes and solid interpretation of their contribution to cancer initiation and development. However, this venture is characterized by various challenges, such as the high number of neutral passenger mutations and the complexity of the biological networks affected by driver mutations. Based on biological pathway and network information, sophisticated computational methods have been developed to facilitate the detection of cancer driver mutations and pathways. They can be categorized into (1) methods using known pathways from public databases, (2) network-based methods, and (3) methods learning cancer pathways de novo. Methods in the first two categories use and integrate different types of data, such as biological pathways, protein interaction networks, and gene expression measurements. The third category consists of de novo methods that detect combinatorial patterns of somatic mutations across tumor samples, such as mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence. In this review, we discuss recent advances, current limitations, and future challenges of these approaches for detecting cancer genes and pathways. We also discuss the most important current resources of cancer-related genes.

Both inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity have crucial implications for clinical practices. Here, we review computational methods that use somatic alterations measured through next-generation DNA sequencing technologies for characterizing tumor heterogeneity and its association with clinical variables. We first review computational methods for studying inter-tumor heterogeneity, focusing on methods that attempt to summarize cancer heterogeneity by discovering pathways that are commonly mutated across different patients of the same cancer type. We then review computational methods for characterizing intra-tumor heterogeneity using information from bulk sequencing data or from single cell sequencing data. Finally, we present some of the recent computational methodologies that have been proposed to identify and assess the association between inter- or intra-tumor heterogeneity with clinical variables.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hristov, Borislav H</author><author>Singh, Mona</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Network-Based Coverage of Mutational Profiles Reveals Cancer Genes.</title><secondary-title>Cell systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell systems</full-title></periodical><pages>221-229.e4</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>TCGA</keyword><keyword>cancer driver genes</keyword><keyword>cancer genomes</keyword><keyword>mutation frequency</keyword><keyword>network-based analysis</keyword><keyword>pathways</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>9783319569697</isbn><accession-num>28957656</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cels.2017.09.003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Not likely to be a very useful tool compared to HotNet2

While commonly mutated cancer genes are readily identifiable, those that are rarely mutated across samples are difficult to distinguish from the large numbers of other infrequently mutated genes. We introduce a method, nCOP, that considers per-individual mutational profiles within the context of protein-protein interaction networks in order to identify small connected subnetworks of genes that, while not individually frequently mutated, comprise pathways that are altered across (i.e., &quot;cover&quot;) a large fraction of individuals. By analyzing 6,038 samples across 24 different cancer types, we demonstrate that nCOP is highly effective in identifying cancer genes, including those with low mutation frequencies. Overall, our work demonstrates that combining per-individual mutational information with interaction networks is a powerful approach for tackling the mutational heterogeneity observed across cancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cava, Claudia</author><author>Bertoli, Gloria</author><author>Colaprico, Antonio</author><author>Olsen, Catharina</author><author>Bontempi, Gianluca</author><author>Castiglioni, Isabella</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integration of multiple networks and pathways identifies cancer driver genes in pan-cancer analysis.</title><secondary-title>BMC genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC genomics</full-title></periodical><pages>25</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Genes</keyword><keyword>Multi-networks</keyword><keyword>Pan-cancer</keyword><keyword>Pathways</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><isbn>14712164 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>29304754</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12864-017-4423-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Cava et al. - BMC genomics - Integration of multiple networks and pathways identifies cancer driver genes in pan-cancer analysis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-4423-x</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29304754</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5756345</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Modern high-throughput genomic technologies represent a comprehensive hallmark of molecular changes in pan-cancer studies. Although different cancer gene signatures have been revealed, the mechanism of tumourigenesis has yet to be completely understood. Pathways and networks are important tools to explain the role of genes in functional genomic studies. However, few methods consider the functional non-equal roles of genes in pathways and the complex gene-gene interactions in a network. RESULTS We present a novel method in pan-cancer analysis that identifies de-regulated genes with a functional role by integrating pathway and network data. A pan-cancer analysis of 7158 tumour/normal samples from 16 cancer types identified 895 genes with a central role in pathways and de-regulated in cancer. Comparing our approach with 15 current tools that identify cancer driver genes, we found that 35.6% of the 895 genes identified by our method have been found as cancer driver genes with at least 2/15 tools. Finally, we applied a machine learning algorithm on 16 independent GEO cancer datasets to validate the diagnostic role of cancer driver genes for each cancer. We obtained a list of the top-ten cancer driver genes for each cancer considered in this study. CONCLUSIONS Our analysis 1) confirmed that there are several known cancer driver genes in common among different types of cancer, 2) highlighted that cancer driver genes are able to regulate crucial pathways.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Dushlaine, Colm</author><author>Kenny, Elaine</author><author>Heron, Elizabeth A</author><author>Segurado, Ricardo</author><author>Gill, Michael</author><author>Morris, Derek W</author><author>Corvin, Aiden</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The SNP ratio test: pathway analysis of genome-wide association datasets.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>2762-3</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>1367-4811</isbn><accession-num>19620097</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btp448</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - O'Dushlaine et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - The SNP ratio test pathway analysis of genome-wide association datasets.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/25/20/2762/193100</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19620097</url></web-urls></urls><label>proj:comut</label><abstract>UNLABELLED We present a tool that assesses the enrichment of significant associations from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a pathway context.

However, the genetic variants discovered through these efforts account for only a small proportion of the heritability of complex traits. One explanation for the missing heritability is that the common analysis approach, assessing the effect of each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually, is not well suited to the detection of small effects of multiple SNPs. Gene set analysis (GSA) is one of several approaches that may contribute to the discovery of additional genetic risk factors for complex traits. Complex phenotypes are thought to be controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of sets of genes. By assessing the overall evidence of association of a phenotype with all measured variation in a set of genes, GSA may identify functionally relevant sets of genes corresponding to relevant biomolecular pathways, which will enable more focused studies of genetic risk factors. This approach may thus contribute to the discovery of genetic variants responsible for some of the missing heritability. With the increased use of these approaches for the secondary analysis of data from GWAS, it is important to understand the different GSA methods and their strengths and weaknesses, and consider challenges inherent in these types of analyses. This paper provides an overview of GSA, highlighting the key challenges, potential solutions, and directions for ongoing research.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mooney, Michael A</author><author>Wilmot, Beth</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gene set analysis: A step-by-step guide.</title><secondary-title>American journal of medical genetics.

To provide a remedy, we combined SNP association analysis with the pathway-driven gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), recently developed to facilitate handling of genome-wide gene expression data. The resulting GSEA-SNP method rests on the assumption that SNPs underlying a disease phenotype are enriched in genes constituting a signaling pathway or those with a common regulation. Besides improving power for association mapping, GSEA-SNP may facilitate the identification of disease-associated SNPs and pathways, as well as the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. GSEA-SNP may also help to identify markers with weak effects, undetectable in association studies without pathway consideration.

Many genetic variations, mostly in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been identified in a wide spectrum of diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and psychiatric diseases. A common theme arising from these studies is that the genetic variations discovered by GWAS can only explain a small fraction of the genetic risks associated with the complex diseases. New strategies and statistical approaches are needed to address this lack of explanation. One such approach is the pathway analysis, which considers the genetic variations underlying a biological pathway, rather than separately as in the traditional GWAS studies. A critical challenge in the pathway analysis is how to combine evidences of association over multiple SNPs within a gene and multiple genes within a pathway. Most current methods choose the most significant SNP from each gene as a representative, ignoring the joint action of multiple SNPs within a gene. This approach leads to preferential identification of genes with a greater number of SNPs. RESULTS We describe a SNP-based pathway enrichment method for GWAS studies. The method consists of the following two main steps: 1) for a given pathway, using an adaptive truncated product statistic to identify all representative (potentially more than one) SNPs of each gene, calculating the average number of representative SNPs for the genes, then re-selecting the representative SNPs of genes in the pathway based on this number; and 2) ranking all selected SNPs by the significance of their statistical association with a trait of interest, and testing if the set of SNPs from a particular pathway is significantly enriched with high ranks using a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We applied our method to two large genetically distinct GWAS data sets of schizophrenia, one from European-American (EA) and the other from African-American (AA). In the EA data set, we found 22 pathways with nominal P-value less than or equal to 0.001 and corresponding false discovery rate (FDR) less than 5%. In the AA data set, we found 11 pathways by controlling the same nominal P-value and FDR threshold. Interestingly, 8 of these pathways overlap with those found in the EA sample. We have implemented our method in a JAVA software package, called SNP Set Enrichment Analysis (SSEA), which contains a user-friendly interface and is freely available at http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/SSEA. CONCLUSIONS The SNP-based pathway enrichment method described here offers a new alternative approach for analysing GWAS data. By applying it to schizophrenia GWAS studies, we show that our method is able to identify statistically significant pathways, and importantly, pathways that can be replicated in large genetically distinct samples.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zappia, Luke</author><author>Phipson, Belinda</author><author>Oshlack, Alicia</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Schneidman, Dina</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring the single-cell RNA-seq analysis landscape with the scRNA-tools database.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1006245</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Public Library of Science</publisher><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>29939984</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006245</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Zappia, Phipson, Oshlack - PLoS computational biology - Exploring the single-cell RNA-seq analysis landscape with the scRNA-tools.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006245</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29939984</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6034903</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have become more widespread the number of tools designed to analyse these data has dramatically increased. Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records the growth of the field over time.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adhikari, Shishir</author><author>Moran, Jacob</author><author>Weddle, Christopher</author><author>Hinczewski, Michael</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>MacKerell, Alexander</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Unraveling the mechanism of the cadherin-catenin-actin catch bond.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1006399</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Public Library of Science</publisher><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>30118477</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006399</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Adhikari et al. - PLoS computational biology - Unraveling the mechanism of the cadherin-catenin-actin catch bond.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006399</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30118477</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6114904</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The adherens junctions between epithelial cells involve a protein complex formed by E-cadherin, β-catenin, α-catenin and F-actin. The stability of this complex was a puzzle for many years, since in vitro studies could reconstitute various stable subsets of the individual proteins, but never the entirety. The missing ingredient turned out to be mechanical tension: a recent experiment that applied physiological forces to the complex with an optical tweezer dramatically increased its lifetime, a phenomenon known as catch bonding. However, in the absence of a crystal structure for the full complex, the microscopic details of the catch bond mechanism remain mysterious. Building on structural clues that point to α-catenin as the force transducer, we present a quantitative theoretical model for how the catch bond arises, fully accounting for the experimental lifetime distributions. The underlying hypothesis is that force induces a rotational transition between two conformations of α-catenin, overcoming a significant energy barrier due to a network of salt bridges. This transition allosterically regulates the energies at the interface between α-catenin and F-actin. The model allows us to predict these energetic changes, as well as highlighting the importance of the salt bridge rotational barrier. By stabilizing one of the α-catenin states, this barrier could play a role in how the complex responds to additional in vivo binding partners like vinculin. Since significant conformational energy barriers are a common feature of other adhesion systems that exhibit catch bonds, our model can be adapted into a general theoretical framework for integrating structure and function in a variety of force-regulated protein complexes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Rong</author><author>Ren, Zhao</author><author>Chen, Wei</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Marz, Manja</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>SILGGM: An extensive R package for efficient statistical inference in large-scale gene networks.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1006369</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Public Library of Science</publisher><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>30102702</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006369</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Zhang, Ren, Chen - PLoS computational biology - SILGGM An extensive R package for efficient statistical inference in large-scale.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006369</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102702</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Gene co-expression network analysis is extremely useful in interpreting a complex biological process. The recent droplet-based single-cell technology is able to generate much larger gene expression data routinely with thousands of samples and tens of thousands of genes. To analyze such a large-scale gene-gene network, remarkable progress has been made in rigorous statistical inference of high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model (GGM). These approaches provide a formal confidence interval or a p-value rather than only a single point estimator for conditional dependence of a gene pair and are more desirable for identifying reliable gene networks. To promote their widespread use, we herein introduce an extensive and efficient R package named SILGGM (Statistical Inference of Large-scale Gaussian Graphical Model) that includes four main approaches in statistical inference of high-dimensional GGM. Unlike the existing tools, SILGGM provides statistically efficient inference on both individual gene pair and whole-scale gene pairs. It has a novel and consistent false discovery rate (FDR) procedure in all four methodologies. Based on the user-friendly design, it provides outputs compatible with multiple platforms for interactive network visualization. Furthermore, comparisons in simulation illustrate that SILGGM can accelerate the existing MATLAB implementation to several orders of magnitudes and further improve the speed of the already very efficient R package FastGGM. Testing results from the simulated data confirm the validity of all the approaches in SILGGM even in a very large-scale setting with the number of variables or genes to a ten thousand level. We have also applied our package to a novel single-cell RNA-seq data set with pan T cells. The results show that the approaches in SILGGM significantly outperform the conventional ones in a biological sense.

There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses. To this end, we developed scPipe, an R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X, Drop-seq and Smart-seq. scPipe produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. scPipe performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of open-source scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor and beyond. The scPipe R package is available for download from https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/scPipe.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Porte, J De La</author><author>Herbst, Bm</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An introduction to diffusion maps</title><secondary-title>… Sciences, University of …</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>… Sciences, University of …</full-title></periodical><pages>11</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10019.1/45333</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2008 - Porte, Herbst - … Sciences, University of … - An introduction to diffusion maps.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://inside.mines.edu/~whereman/papers/delaPorte-Herbst-Hereman-vanderWalt-PRASA-2008.pdf</url><url>http://dip.sun.ac.za/~herbst/research/publications/diff_maps_prasa2008.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper describes a mathematical technique [1] for dealing with dimensionality reduction. Given data in a high-dimensional space, we show how to find parameters that describe the lower-dimensional structures of which it is comprised. Unlike other popular methods such as Principle Component Analysis and Multi-dimensional Scaling, diffusion maps are non-linear and focus on discovering the underlying manifold (lower-dimensional constrained “surface” upon which the data is embedded). By integrating local similarities at different scales, a global description of the data-set is obtained. In comparisons, it is shown that the technique is robust to noise perturbation and is computationally inexpensive. Illustrative examples and an open implementation are given.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scialdone, Antonio</author><author>Natarajan, Kedar N</author><author>Saraiva, Luis R</author><author>Proserpio, Valentina</author><author>Teichmann, Sarah A</author><author>Stegle, Oliver</author><author>Marioni, John C</author><author>Buettner, Florian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computational assignment of cell-cycle stage from single-cell transcriptome data.</title><secondary-title>Methods (San Diego, Calif.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Methods (San Diego, Calif.)</full-title></periodical><pages>54-61</pages><volume>85</volume><keywords><keyword>Cell cycle</keyword><keyword>Computational biology</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword><keyword>Single cell RNA-seq</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26142758</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.06.021</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Scialdone et al. - Methods (San Diego, Calif.) - Computational assignment of cell-cycle stage from single-cell transcriptome data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26142758</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The transcriptome of single cells can reveal important information about cellular states and heterogeneity within populations of cells. Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing has facilitated expression profiling of large numbers of single cells in parallel. To fully exploit these data, it is critical that suitable computational approaches are developed. One key challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five established supervised machine learning methods and a custom-built predictor for allocating cells to their cell-cycle stage on the basis of their transcriptome. In particular, we assess the impact of different normalisation strategies and the usage of prior knowledge on the predictive power of the classifiers. We tested the methods on previously published datasets and found that a PCA-based approach and the custom predictor performed best. Moreover, our analysis shows that the performance depends strongly on normalisation and the usage of prior knowledge. Only by leveraging prior knowledge in form of cell-cycle annotated genes and by preprocessing the data using a rank-based normalisation, is it possible to robustly capture the transcriptional cell-cycle signature across different cell types, organisms and experimental protocols.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buettner, Florian</author><author>Pratanwanich, Naruemon</author><author>McCarthy, Davis J.</author><author>Marioni, John C</author><author>Stegle, Oliver</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>f-scLVM: scalable and versatile factor analysis for single-cell RNA-seq.</title><secondary-title>Genome biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome biology</full-title></periodical><pages>212</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Gene set annotations</keyword><keyword>Single-cell RNA-seq</keyword><keyword>Sparse factor analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>29115968</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13059-017-1334-8</electronic-resource-num><notes>[14] -- a PCA method for same purpose</notes><research-notes>[14] -- a PCA method for same purpose</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Buettner et al. - Genome biology - f-scLVM scalable and versatile factor analysis for single-cell RNA-seq.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13059-017-1334-8</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29115968</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5674756</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows studying heterogeneity in gene expression in large cell populations. Such heterogeneity can arise due to technical or biological factors, making decomposing sources of variation difficult. We here describe f-scLVM (factorial single-cell latent variable model), a method based on factor analysis that uses pathway annotations to guide the inference of interpretable factors underpinning the heterogeneity. Our model jointly estimates the relevance of individual factors, refines gene set annotations, and infers factors without annotation. In applications to multiple scRNA-seq datasets, we find that f-scLVM robustly decomposes scRNA-seq datasets into interpretable components, thereby facilitating the identification of novel subpopulations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bacher, Rhonda</author><author>Chu, Li-Fang</author><author>Leng, Ning</author><author>Gasch, Audrey P</author><author>Thomson, James A</author><author>Stewart, Ron M</author><author>Newton, Michael</author><author>Kendziorski, Christina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SCnorm: robust normalization of single-cell RNA-seq data.</title><secondary-title>Nature methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature methods</full-title></periodical><pages>584-586</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28418000</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nmeth.4263</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Bacher et al. - Nature methods - SCnorm robust normalization of single-cell RNA-seq data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28418000</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5473255</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The normalization of RNA-seq data is essential for accurate downstream inference, but the assumptions upon which most normalization methods are based are not applicable in the single-cell setting.

This provides biological resolution that cannot be matched by bulk RNA sequencing, at the cost of increased technical noise and data complexity. The differences between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of scRNA-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available datasets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. This will provide a range of usage scenarios from which readers can construct their own analysis pipelines.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buettner, Florian</author><author>Natarajan, Kedar N</author><author>Casale, F.

However, the effects of potential confounding factors, such as the cell cycle, on the heterogeneity of gene expression and therefore on the ability to robustly identify subpopulations remain unclear. We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Siegel, Rebecca L.</author><author>Miller, Kimberly D.</author><author>Jemal, Ahmedin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cancer statistics, 2018.</title><secondary-title>CA: a cancer journal for clinicians</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CA: a cancer journal for clinicians</full-title></periodical><pages>7-30</pages><volume>68</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>cancer cases</keyword><keyword>cancer statistics</keyword><keyword>death rates</keyword><keyword>incidence</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>American Cancer Society</publisher><isbn>1542-4863 (Electronic)\r0007-9235 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>29313949</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3322/caac.21442</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Siegel, Miller, Jemal - CA a cancer journal for clinicians - Cancer statistics, 2018.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.3322/caac.21442</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25559415</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29313949</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. Incidence data, available through 2014, were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data, available through 2015, were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2018, 1,735,350 new cancer cases and 609,640 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Over the past decade of data, the cancer incidence rate (2005-2014) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2% annually in men, while the cancer death rate (2006-2015) declined by about 1.5% annually in both men and women. The combined cancer death rate dropped continuously from 1991 to 2015 by a total of 26%, translating to approximately 2,378,600 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Of the 10 leading causes of death, only cancer declined from 2014 to 2015. In 2015, the cancer death rate was 14% higher in non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) overall (death rate ratio [DRR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.13-1.15), but the racial disparity was much larger for individuals aged &lt;65 years (DRR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.29-1.32) compared with those aged ≥65 years (DRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09) and varied substantially by state. For example, the cancer death rate was lower in NHBs than NHWs in Massachusetts for all ages and in New York for individuals aged ≥65 years, whereas for those aged &lt;65 years, it was 3 times higher in NHBs in the District of Columbia (DRR, 2.89; 95% CI, 2.16-3.91) and about 50% higher in Wisconsin (DRR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.56-2.02), Kansas (DRR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.25-1.81), Louisiana (DRR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.38-1.60), Illinois (DRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.39-1.57), and California (DRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.38-1.54). Larger racial inequalities in young and middle-aged adults probably partly reflect less access to high-quality health care.

Recent imaging approaches opened exciting perspectives for understanding the intricate mechanisms regulating RNA metabolism, from synthesis to decay. Imaging techniques allow their observation at high spatial and temporal resolution, while keeping cellular morphology and micro-environment intact. Here, we focus on approaches for imaging single RNA molecules in cells, tissues, and embryos. In fixed cells, the rapid development of smFISH multiplexing opens the way to large-scale single-molecule studies, while in live cells, gene expression can be observed in real time in its native context. We highlight the strengths and limitations of these methods, as well as future challenges. We present how they advanced our understanding of gene expression heterogeneity and bursting, as well as the spatiotemporal aspects of splicing, translation, and RNA decay. These insights yield a dynamic and stochastic view of gene expression in single cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hwang, Byungjin</author><author>Lee, Ji Hyun</author><author>Bang, Duhee</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines.</title><secondary-title>Experimental &amp; molecular medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental &amp; molecular medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>96</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Sequencing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>30089861</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s12276-018-0071-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Hwang, Lee, Bang - Experimental &amp; molecular medicine - Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-018-0071-8</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089861</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Rapid progress in the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in recent years has provided many valuable insights into complex biological systems, ranging from cancer genomics to diverse microbial communities. NGS-based technologies for genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics are now increasingly focused on the characterization of individual cells. These single-cell analyses will allow researchers to uncover new and potentially unexpected biological discoveries relative to traditional profiling methods that assess bulk populations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), for example, can reveal complex and rare cell populations, uncover regulatory relationships between genes, and track the trajectories of distinct cell lineages in development. In this review, we will focus on technical challenges in single-cell isolation and library preparation and on computational analysis pipelines available for analyzing scRNA-seq data. Further technical improvements at the level of molecular and cell biology and in available bioinformatics tools will greatly facilitate both the basic science and medical applications of these sequencing technologies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>AlJanahi, Aisha A</author><author>Danielsen, Mark</author><author>Dunbar, Cynthia E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Introduction to the Analysis of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data.</title><secondary-title>Molecular therapy.

However, no previous study has been extended to provide a comprehensive analysis of pathways disrupted by copy number alterations across different human cancers. Towards this goal, we propose a network-based method to integrate copy number alteration data with human protein-protein interaction networks and pathway databases to identify pathways that are commonly disrupted in many different types of cancer. RESULTS We applied our approach to a data set of 2,172 cancer patients across 16 different types of cancers, and discovered a set of commonly disrupted pathways, which are likely essential for tumor formation in majority of the cancers. We also identified pathways that are only disrupted in specific cancer types, providing molecular markers for different human cancers. Analysis with independent microarray gene expression datasets confirms that the commonly disrupted pathways can be used to identify patient subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes. We also provide a network view of disrupted pathways to explain how copy number alterations affect pathways that regulate cell growth, cycle, and differentiation for tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS In this work, we demonstrated that the network-based integrative analysis can help to identify pathways disrupted by copy number alterations across 16 types of human cancers, which are not readily identifiable by conventional overrepresentation-based and other pathway-based methods.

A central challenge in large-scale genome projects, such as the TCGA GBM project, is the ability to distinguish cancer-causing &quot;driver&quot; mutations from passively selected &quot;passenger&quot; mutations. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS In contrast to a purely frequency based approach to identifying driver mutations in cancer, we propose an automated network-based approach for identifying candidate oncogenic processes and driver genes. The approach is based on the hypothesis that cellular networks contain functional modules, and that tumors target specific modules critical to their growth. Key elements in the approach include combined analysis of sequence mutations and DNA copy number alterations; use of a unified molecular interaction network consisting of both protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways; and identification and statistical assessment of network modules, i.e. cohesive groups of genes of interest with a higher density of interactions within groups than between groups. CONCLUSIONS We confirm and extend the observation that GBM alterations tend to occur within specific functional modules, in spite of considerable patient-to-patient variation, and that two of the largest modules involve signaling via p53, Rb, PI3K and receptor protein kinases. We also identify new candidate drivers in GBM, including AGAP2/CENTG1, a putative oncogene and an activator of the PI3K pathway; and, three additional significantly altered modules, including one involved in microtubule organization. To facilitate the application of our network-based approach to additional cancer types, we make the method freely available as part of a software tool called NetBox.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mayner, William G.

Several computational approaches use transcriptional data to find potential repurposing candidates. The main hypothesis of such approaches is that if gene expression signature of a particular drug is opposite to the gene expression signature of a disease, that drug may have a potential therapeutic effect on the disease. However, this may not be optimal since it fails to consider the different roles of genes and their dependencies at the system level. Results We propose a systems biology approach to discover novel therapeutic roles for established drugs that addresses some of the issues in the current approaches. To do so, we use publicly available drug and disease data to build a drug-disease network by considering all interactions between drug targets and disease-related genes in the context of all known signaling pathways. This network is integrated with gene-expression measurements to identify drugs with new desired therapeutic effects based on a system-level analysis method. We compare the proposed approach with the drug repurposing approach proposed by Sirota et al. on four human diseases: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer. We evaluate the proposed approach based on its ability to re-discover drugs that are already FDA-approved for a given disease.

Since the human protein interaction network (hPIN) has a complex architecture, we hypothesized that uncovering its latent geometry could ease challenging problems in systems biology, translating them into measuring distances between proteins. Results We embedded the hPIN to hyperbolic space and found that the inferred coordinates of nodes capture biologically relevant features, like protein age, function and cellular localization. This means that the representation of the hPIN in the two-dimensional hyperbolic plane offers a novel and informative way to visualize proteins and their interactions. We then used these coordinates to compute hyperbolic distances between proteins, which served as likelihood scores for the prediction of plausible protein interactions. Finally, we observed that proteins can efficiently communicate with each other via a greedy routing process, guided by the latent geometry of the hPIN. We show that these efficient communication channels can be used to determine the core members of signal transduction pathways and to study how system perturbations impact their efficiency.

However, most previous methods aim to maximize the similarity of aligned proteins in pairwise networks, while concerning little about the feature of connectivity in these substructures, such as the protein complexes. RESULTS In this paper, we identify the problem of finding conserved protein complexes, which requires the aligned proteins in a PPI network to form a connected subnetwork. By taking the feature of connectivity into consideration, we propose ConnectedAlign, an efficient method to find conserved protein complexes from multiple PPI networks. The proposed method improves the coverage significantly without compromising of the consistency in the aligned results. In this way, the knowledge of protein complexes in well-studied species can be extended to that of poor-studied species. CONCLUSIONS We conducted extensive experiments on real PPI networks of four species, including human, yeast, fruit fly and worm. The experimental results demonstrate dominant benefits of the proposed method in finding protein complexes across multiple species.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peng, Shaoliang</author><author>Cheng, Minxia</author><author>Huang, Kaiwen</author><author>Cui, YingBo</author><author>Zhang, Zhiqiang</author><author>Guo, Runxin</author><author>Zhang, Xiaoyu</author><author>Yang, Shunyun</author><author>Liao, Xiangke</author><author>Lu, Yutong</author><author>Zou, Quan</author><author>Shi, Benyun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficient computation of motif discovery on Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) Architecture.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>282</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>Suppl 9</issue><keywords><keyword>MEME</keyword><keyword>MIC</keyword><keyword>Motif discovery</keyword><keyword>Offload mode</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><accession-num>30367570</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2276-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Peng et al. - BMC bioinformatics - Efficient computation of motif discovery on Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) Architecture.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2276-1</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30367570</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Novel sequence motifs detection is becoming increasingly essential in computational biology.

THe double haploid technique that uses fewer breeding generations for generating a maize line has accelerated the pace of development of superior commercial seed varieties and has been transforming the agricultural industry. In this technique the chromosomes of the haploid seeds are doubled and taken forward in the process while the diploids marked for elimination. Traditionally, selective visual expression of a molecular marker within the embryo region of a maize seed has been used to manually discriminate diploids from haploids. Large scale production of inbred maize lines within the agricultural industry would benefit from the development of computer vision methods for this discriminatory task. However the variability in the phenotypic expression of the molecular marker system and the heterogeneity arising out of the maize genotypes and image acquisition have been an enduring challenge towards such efforts. RESULTS In this work, we propose a novel application of a deep convolutional network (DeepSort) for the sorting of haploid seeds in these realistic settings. Our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers that uses features based on color, texture and morphology. We demonstrate the network derives features that can discriminate the embryo regions using the activations of the neurons in the convolutional layers. Our experiments with different architectures show that the performance decreases with the decrease in the depth of the layers. CONCLUSION Our proposed method DeepSort based on the convolutional network is robust to the variation in the phenotypic expression, shape of the corn seeds, and the embryo pose with respect to the camera. In the era of modern digital agriculture, deep learning and convolutional networks will continue to play an important role in advancing research and product development within the agricultural industry.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Akbani, Rehan</author><author>Ng, Patrick Kwok Shing</author><author>Werner, Henrica M J</author><author>Shahmoradgoli, Maria</author><author>Zhang, Fan</author><author>Ju, Zhenlin</author><author>Liu, Wenbin</author><author>Yang, Ji-Yeon</author><author>Yoshihara, Kosuke</author><author>Li, Jun</author><author>Ling, Shiyun</author><author>Seviour, Elena G.</author><author>Ram, Prahlad T.</author><author>Minna, John D.</author><author>Diao, Lixia</author><author>Tong, Pan</author><author>Heymach, John V.</author><author>Hill, Steven M.</author><author>Dondelinger, Frank</author><author>Städler, Nicolas</author><author>Byers, Lauren A.</author><author>Meric-Bernstam, Funda</author><author>Weinstein, John N.</author><author>Broom, Bradley M.</author><author>Verhaak, Roeland G W</author><author>Liang, Han</author><author>Mukherjee, Sach</author><author>Lu, Yiling</author><author>Mills, Gordon B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A pan-cancer proteomic perspective on The Cancer Genome Atlas.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>3887</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer genomics</keyword><keyword>Computational biology and bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Proteomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><isbn>2041-1723</isbn><accession-num>24871328</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms4887</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Akbani et al. - Nature communications - A pan-cancer proteomic perspective on The Cancer Genome Atlas.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4887</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871328</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4109726</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Protein levels and function are poorly predicted by genomic and transcriptomic analysis of patient tumours. Therefore, direct study of the functional proteome has the potential to provide a wealth of information that complements and extends genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) projects. Here we use reverse-phase protein arrays to analyse 3,467 patient samples from 11 TCGA 'Pan-Cancer' diseases, using 181 high-quality antibodies that target 128 total proteins and 53 post-translationally modified proteins. The resultant proteomic data are integrated with genomic and transcriptomic analyses of the same samples to identify commonalities, differences, emergent pathways and network biology within and across tumour lineages. In addition, tissue-specific signals are reduced computationally to enhance biomarker and target discovery spanning multiple tumour lineages. This integrative analysis, with an emphasis on pathways and potentially actionable proteins, provides a framework for determining the prognostic, predictive and therapeutic relevance of the functional proteome.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McGinnis, Christopher S</author><author>Murrow, Lyndsay M</author><author>Gartner, Zev J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DoubletFinder: Doublet detection in single-cell RNA sequencing data using artificial nearest neighbors</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>352484</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/352484</electronic-resource-num><notes>Could imporove on this by selecting the samples for making the artificial doublets in a smart way.

These technical artifacts are caused by cell doublets formed during cell capture and occur at a frequency proportional to the total number of sequenced cells. The presence of doublets can lead to spurious biological conclusions, which justifies the practice of sequencing fewer cells to limit doublet formation rates. Here, we present a computational doublet detection tool - DoubletFinder - that identifies doublets based solely on gene expression features. DoubletFinder infers the putative gene expression profile of real doublets by generating artificial doublets from existing scRNA-seq data. Neighborhood detection in gene expression space then identifies sequenced cells with increased probability of being doublets based on their proximity to artificial doublets. DoubletFinder robustly identifies doublets across scRNA-seq datasets with variable numbers of cells and sequencing depth, and predicts false-negative and false-positive doublets defined using conventional barcoding approaches. We anticipate that DoubletFinder will aid in scRNA-seq data analysis and will increase the throughput and accuracy of scRNA-seq experiments.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kang, Hyun Min</author><author>Subramaniam, Meena</author><author>Targ, Sasha</author><author>Nguyen, Michelle</author><author>Maliskova, Lenka</author><author>McCarthy, Elizabeth</author><author>Wan, Eunice</author><author>Wong, Simon</author><author>Byrnes, Lauren</author><author>Lanata, Cristina M</author><author>Gate, Rachel E</author><author>Mostafavi, Sara</author><author>Marson, Alexander</author><author>Zaitlen, Noah</author><author>Criswell, Lindsey A</author><author>Ye, Chun Jimmie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiplexed droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing using natural genetic variation.</title><secondary-title>Nature biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>89-94</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Genome informatics</keyword><keyword>Transcriptomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>29227470</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nbt.4042</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Kang et al. - Nature biotechnology - Multiplexed droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing using natural genetic variation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nbt.4042</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29227470</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5784859</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing (dscRNA-seq) has enabled rapid, massively parallel profiling of transcriptomes. However, assessing differential expression across multiple individuals has been hampered by inefficient sample processing and technical batch effects. Here we describe a computational tool, demuxlet, that harnesses natural genetic variation to determine the sample identity of each droplet containing a single cell (singlet) and detect droplets containing two cells (doublets). These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per cell are sufficient to assign 97% of singlets and identify 92% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of &gt;99% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. We apply demuxlet to assess cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in 8 pooled lupus patient samples treated with interferon (IFN)-β and perform eQTL analysis on 23 pooled samples.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leung, Marco L</author><author>Davis, Alexander</author><author>Gao, Ruli</author><author>Casasent, Anna</author><author>Wang, Yong</author><author>Sei, Emi</author><author>Vilar, Eduardo</author><author>Maru, Dipen</author><author>Kopetz, Scott</author><author>Navin, Nicholas E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell DNA sequencing reveals a late-dissemination model in metastatic colorectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>Genome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome research</full-title></periodical><pages>1287-1299</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28546418</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.209973.116</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Leung et al. - Genome research - Single-cell DNA sequencing reveals a late-dissemination model in metastatic colorectal cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.209973.116.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28546418</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5538546</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Metastasis is a complex biological process that has been difficult to delineate in human colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. A major obstacle in understanding metastatic lineages is the extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity at the primary and metastatic tumor sites. To address this problem, we developed a highly multiplexed single-cell DNA sequencing approach to trace the metastatic lineages of two CRC patients with matched liver metastases. Single-cell copy number or mutational profiling was performed, in addition to bulk exome and targeted deep-sequencing. In the first patient, we observed monoclonal seeding, in which a single clone evolved a large number of mutations prior to migrating to the liver to establish the metastatic tumor. In the second patient, we observed polyclonal seeding, in which two independent clones seeded the metastatic liver tumor after having diverged at different time points from the primary tumor lineage. The single-cell data also revealed an unexpected independent tumor lineage that did not metastasize, and early progenitor clones with the &quot;first hit&quot; mutation in APC that subsequently gave rise to both the primary and metastatic tumors. Collectively, these data reveal a late-dissemination model of metastasis in two CRC patients and provide an unprecedented view of metastasis at single-cell genomic resolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Svensson, Valentine</author><author>Natarajan, Kedar Nath</author><author>Ly, Lam-Ha</author><author>Miragaia, Ricardo J</author><author>Labalette, Charlotte</author><author>Macaulay, Iain C</author><author>Cvejic, Ana</author><author>Teichmann, Sarah A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Power analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments.</title><secondary-title>Nature methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature methods</full-title></periodical><pages>381-387</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Gene expression</keyword><keyword>RNA sequencing</keyword><keyword>Transcriptomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><isbn>1548-7105 (Electronic) 1548-7091 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>28263961</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nmeth.4220</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Svensson et al. - Nature methods - Power analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29506-3</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30046134</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6060100</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263961</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.f</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an established and powerful method to investigate transcriptomic cell-to-cell variation, thereby revealing new cell types and providing insights into developmental processes and transcriptional stochasticity.

A thorough understanding of a tumour's subclonal composition and its mutational history is essential to open up the design of treatments tailored to individual patients. Comparative studies on a large number of tumours permit the identification of mutational patterns which may refine forecasts of cancer progression, response to treatment and metastatic potential. The composition of tumours is shaped by evolutionary processes. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing offer the possibility to analyse the evolutionary history and accompanying heterogeneity of tumours at an unprecedented resolution, by sequencing single cells. New computational challenges arise when moving from bulk to single-cell sequencing data, leading to the development of novel modelling frameworks. In this review, we present the state of the art methods for understanding the phylogeny encoded in bulk or single-cell sequencing data, and highlight future directions for developing more comprehensive and informative pictures of tumour evolution.

To depict the baseline landscape of the composition, lineage and functional states of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, here we performed deep single-cell RNA sequencing for 12,346 T cells from 14 treatment-naïve non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Combined expression and T cell antigen receptor based lineage tracking revealed a significant proportion of inter-tissue effector T cells with a highly migratory nature. As well as tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells undergoing exhaustion, we observed two clusters of cells exhibiting states preceding exhaustion, and a high ratio of &quot;pre-exhausted&quot; to exhausted T cells was associated with better prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, we observed further heterogeneity within the tumor regulatory T cells (Tregs), characterized by the bimodal distribution of TNFRSF9, an activation marker for antigen-specific Tregs. The gene signature of those activated tumor Tregs, which included IL1R2, correlated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Our study provides a new approach for patient stratification and will help further understand the functional states and dynamics of T cells in lung cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ziegenhain, Christoph</author><author>Vieth, Beate</author><author>Parekh, Swati</author><author>Reinius, Björn</author><author>Guillaumet-Adkins, Amy</author><author>Smets, Martha</author><author>Leonhardt, Heinrich</author><author>Heyn, Holger</author><author>Hellmann, Ines</author><author>Enard, Wolfgang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative Analysis of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Methods.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cell</full-title></periodical><pages>631-643.e4</pages><volume>65</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>cost-effectiveness</keyword><keyword>method comparison</keyword><keyword>power analysis</keyword><keyword>simulation</keyword><keyword>single-cell RNA-seq</keyword><keyword>transcriptomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Cell Press</publisher><isbn>1097-2765</isbn><accession-num>28212749</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molcel.2017.01.023</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Ziegenhain et al. - Molecular cell - Comparative Analysis of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Methods.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276517300497</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212749</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new possibilities to address biological and medical questions.

While Smart-seq2 detected the most genes per cell and across cells, CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, and SCRB-seq quantified mRNA levels with less amplification noise due to the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Power simulations at different sequencing depths showed that Drop-seq is more cost-efficient for transcriptome quantification of large numbers of cells, while MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, and Smart-seq2 are more efficient when analyzing fewer cells. Our quantitative comparison offers the basis for an informed choice among six prominent scRNA-seq methods, and it provides a framework for benchmarking further improvements of scRNA-seq protocols.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Yan</author><author>Ni, Xiaohui</author><author>Guo, Hua</author><author>Su, Zhe</author><author>Ba, Yi</author><author>Tong, Zhongsheng</author><author>Guo, Zhi</author><author>Yao, Xin</author><author>Chen, Xixi</author><author>Yin, Jian</author><author>Yan, Zhao</author><author>Guo, Lin</author><author>Liu, Ying</author><author>Bai, Fan</author><author>Xie, X Sunney</author><author>Zhang, Ning</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell sequencing deciphers a convergent evolution of copy number alterations from primary to circulating tumor cells.</title><secondary-title>Genome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome research</full-title></periodical><pages>1312-1322</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><accession-num>28487279</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.216788.116</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Gao et al. - Genome research - Single-cell sequencing deciphers a convergent evolution of copy number alterations from primary to.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.216788.116.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28487279</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5538548</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Copy number alteration (CNA) is a major contributor to genome instability, a hallmark of cancer. Here, we studied genomic alterations in single primary tumor cells and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the same patient. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in single cells from both samples occurred sporadically, whereas CNAs among primary tumor cells emerged accumulatively rather than abruptly, converging toward the CNA in CTCs. Focal CNAs affecting the MYC gene and the PTEN gene were observed only in a minor portion of primary tumor cells but were present in all CTCs, suggesting a strong selection toward metastasis. Single-cell structural variant (SV) analyses revealed a two-step mechanism, a complex rearrangement followed by gene amplification, for the simultaneous formation of anomalous CNAs in multiple chromosome regions. Integrative CNA analyses of 97 CTCs from 23 patients confirmed the convergence of CNAs and revealed single, concurrent, and mutually exclusive CNAs that could be the driving events in cancer metastasis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Zhao</author><author>Li, Chong</author><author>Fan, Zusen</author><author>Liu, Hongjie</author><author>Zhang, Xiaolong</author><author>Cai, Zhiming</author><author>Xu, Liqin</author><author>Luo, Jian</author><author>Huang, Yi</author><author>He, Luyun</author><author>Liu, Chunxiao</author><author>Wu, Song</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell Sequencing Reveals Variants in ARID1A, GPRC5A and MLL2 Driving Self-renewal of Human Bladder Cancer Stem Cells.</title><secondary-title>European urology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European urology</full-title></periodical><pages>8-12</pages><volume>71</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>bladder cancer</keyword><keyword>bladder cancer stem cells</keyword><keyword>genetic alteration</keyword><keyword>self-renewal</keyword><keyword>single-cell sequencing</keyword><keyword>tumor evolution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><isbn>1873-7560 (Electronic)\r0302-2838 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>27387124</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eururo.2016.06.025</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Yang et al. - European urology - Single-cell Sequencing Reveals Variants in ARID1A, GPRC5A and MLL2 Driving Self-renewal of Human.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283816303438</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27387124</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancer stem cells are considered responsible for many important aspects of tumors such as their self-renewal, tumor-initiating, drug-resistance and metastasis. However, the genetic basis and origination of human bladder cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remains unknown. Here, we conducted single-cell sequencing on 59 cells including BCSCs, bladder cancer non-stem cells (BCNSCs), bladder epithelial stem cells (BESCs) and bladder epithelial non-stem cells (BENSCs) from three bladder cancer (BC) specimens. Specifically, BCSCs demonstrate clonal homogeneity and suggest their origin from BESCs or BCNSCs through phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, 21 key altered genes were identified in BCSCs including six genes not previously described in BC (ETS1, GPRC5A, MKL1, PAWR, PITX2 and RGS9BP). Co-mutations of ARID1A, GPRC5A and MLL2 introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 significantly enhance the capabilities of self-renewal and tumor-initiating of BCNSCs. To our knowledge, our study first provides an overview of the genetic basis of human BCSCs with single-cell sequencing and demonstrates the biclonal origin of human BCSCs via evolution analysis. PATIENT SUMMARY Human bladder cancer stem cells show the high level of consistency and may derived from bladder epithelial stem cells or bladder cancer non-stem cells. Mutations of ARID1A, GPRC5A and MLL2 grant bladder cancer non-stem cells the capability of self-renewal.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuipers, Jack</author><author>Jahn, Katharina</author><author>Raphael, Benjamin J</author><author>Beerenwinkel, Niko</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell sequencing data reveal widespread recurrence and loss of mutational hits in the life histories of tumors.</title><secondary-title>Genome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome research</full-title></periodical><pages>1885-1894</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>29030470</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.220707.117</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Kuipers et al. - Genome research - Single-cell sequencing data reveal widespread recurrence and loss of mutational hits in the li.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.220707.117.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030470</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5668945</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Intra-tumor heterogeneity poses substantial challenges for cancer treatment. A tumor's composition can be deduced by reconstructing its mutational history. Central to current approaches is the infinite sites assumption that every genomic position can only mutate once over the lifetime of a tumor. The validity of this assumption has never been quantitatively assessed. We developed a rigorous statistical framework to test the infinite sites assumption with single-cell sequencing data. Our framework accounts for the high noise and contamination present in such data. We found strong evidence for the same genomic position being mutationally affected multiple times in individual tumors for 11 of 12 single-cell sequencing data sets from a variety of human cancers. Seven cases involved the loss of earlier mutations, five of which occurred at sites unaffected by large-scale genomic deletions. Four cases exhibited a parallel mutation, potentially indicating convergent evolution at the base pair level. Our results refute the general validity of the infinite sites assumption and indicate that more complex models are needed to adequately quantify intra-tumor heterogeneity for more effective cancer treatment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baslan, Timour</author><author>Hicks, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unravelling biology and shifting paradigms in cancer with single-cell sequencing.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

Whether proliferating or quiescent, in the primary tumour mass or disseminated elsewhere, single cells govern the parameters that dictate all facets of the biology of cancer. Thus, single-cell analyses provide the ultimate level of resolution in our quest for a fundamental understanding of this disease. Historically, this quest has been hampered by technological shortcomings. In this Opinion article, we argue that the rapidly evolving field of single-cell sequencing has unshackled the cancer research community of these shortcomings. From furthering an elemental understanding of intra-tumoural genetic heterogeneity and cancer genome evolution to illuminating the governing principles of disease relapse and metastasis, we posit that single-cell sequencing promises to unravel the biology of all facets of this disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoadley, Katherine A</author><author>Yau, Christina</author><author>Hinoue, Toshinori</author><author>Wolf, Denise M</author><author>Lazar, Alexander J.</author><author>Drill, Esther</author><author>Shen, Ronglai</author><author>Taylor, Alison M</author><author>Cherniack, Andrew D.</author><author>Thorsson, Vésteinn</author><author>Akbani, Rehan</author><author>Bowlby, Reanne</author><author>Wong, Christopher K</author><author>Wiznerowicz, Maciej</author><author>Sanchez-Vega, Francisco</author><author>Robertson, A.

We performed molecular clustering using data on chromosome-arm-level aneuploidy, DNA hypermethylation, mRNA, and miRNA expression levels and reverse-phase protein arrays, of which all, except for aneuploidy, revealed clustering primarily organized by histology, tissue type, or anatomic origin. The influence of cell type was evident in DNA-methylation-based clustering, even after excluding sites with known preexisting tissue-type-specific methylation. Integrative clustering further emphasized the dominant role of cell-of-origin patterns. Molecular similarities among histologically or anatomically related cancer types provide a basis for focused pan-cancer analyses, such as pan-gastrointestinal, pan-gynecological, pan-kidney, and pan-squamous cancers, and those related by stemness features, which in turn may inform strategies for future therapeutic development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Camacho, Diogo M</author><author>Collins, Katherine M</author><author>Powers, Rani K</author><author>Costello, James C</author><author>Collins, James J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Next-Generation Machine Learning for Biological Networks.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>1581-1592</pages><volume>173</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Machine leaning</keyword><keyword>deep learning</keyword><keyword>network biology</keyword><keyword>neural networks</keyword><keyword>synthetic biology</keyword><keyword>systems biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>0000000154871</isbn><accession-num>29887378</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.015</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Camacho et al. - Cell - Next-Generation Machine Learning for Biological Networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.015</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27935037</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5339046</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29887378</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Machine learning, a collection of data-analytical techniques aimed at building predictive models from multi-dimensional datasets, is becoming integral to modern biological research.

Here, we stratify TDP tumors by classifying their tandem duplications (TDs) into three span intervals, with modal values of 11 kb, 231 kb, and 1.7 Mb, respectively. TDPs with ∼11 kb TDs feature loss of TP53 and BRCA1. TDPs with ∼231 kb and ∼1.7 Mb TDs associate with CCNE1 pathway activation and CDK12 disruptions, respectively. We demonstrate that p53 and BRCA1 conjoint abrogation drives TDP induction by generating short-span TDP mammary tumors in genetically modified mice lacking them.

Accurate 8-state secondary structure prediction can significantly give more precise and high resolution on structure-based properties analysis. RESULTS We present a novel deep learning architecture which exploits an integrative synergy of prediction by a convolutional neural network, residual network, and bidirectional recurrent neural network to improve the performance of protein secondary structure prediction. A local block comprised of convolutional filters and original input is designed for capturing local sequence features. The subsequent bidirectional recurrent neural network consisting of gated recurrent units can capture global context features. Furthermore, the residual network can improve the information flow between the hidden layers and the cascaded recurrent neural network. Our proposed deep network achieved 71.4% accuracy on the benchmark CB513 dataset for the 8-state prediction; and the ensemble learning by our model achieved 74% accuracy. Our model generalization capability is also evaluated on other three independent datasets CASP10, CASP11 and CASP12 for both 8- and 3-state prediction. These prediction performances are superior to the state-of-the-art methods. CONCLUSION Our experiment demonstrates that it is a valuable method for predicting protein secondary structure, and capturing local and global features concurrently is very useful in deep learning.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fornili, Marco</author><author>Boracchi, Patrizia</author><author>Ambrogi, Federico</author><author>Biganzoli, Elia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling the covariates effects on the hazard function by piecewise exponential artificial neural networks: an application to a controlled clinical trial on renal carcinoma.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>186</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>Suppl 7</issue><keywords><keyword>Hazard function</keyword><keyword>Neural networks</keyword><keyword>Piecewise exponential model</keyword><keyword>Survival analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><accession-num>30066658</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2179-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Fornili et al. - BMC bioinformatics - Modeling the covariates effects on the hazard function by piecewise exponential artificial.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2179-1</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30066658</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6069688</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND In exploring the time course of a disease to support or generate biological hypotheses, the shape of the hazard function provides relevant information.

This adds an extra layer of complexity to the analysis and interpretation, in particular when inferential univariate methods are applied en masse. It is well-known that mass univariate testing suffers from multiplicity issues and although this has been well documented for simple comparative tests, few approaches have focussed on more complex explanatory structures. Two frameworks are introduced incorporating corrections for multiplicity whilst maintaining appropriate structure in the explanatory variables. Within this paradigm, a choice has to be made as to whether multiplicity corrections should be applied to the saturated model, putting emphasis on controlling the rate of false positives, or to the predictive model, where emphasis is on model selection. This choice has implications for both the ranking and selection of the response variables identified as differentially expressed. The theoretical difference is demonstrated between the two approaches along with an empirical study of lipid composition in Arabidopsis under differing levels of salt stress. Multiplicity corrections have an inherent weakness when the full explanatory structure is not properly incorporated. Although a unifying ‘single best’ recommendation is not provided, two reasonable alternatives are provided and the applicability of these approaches is discussed for different scenarios where the aims of analysis will differ. The key result is that the point at which multiplicity is incorporated into the analysis will fundamentally change the interpretation of the results, and the choice of approach should therefore be driven by the specific aims of the experiment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sardina, Davide S.</author><author>Micale, Giovanni</author><author>Ferro, Alfredo</author><author>Pulvirenti, Alfredo</author><author>Giugno, Rosalba</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>INBIA: a boosting methodology for proteomic network inference.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>188</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>Suppl 7</issue><keywords><keyword>Network algorithm</keyword><keyword>Network inference</keyword><keyword>Protein expression</keyword><keyword>Protein interaction network</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><accession-num>30066650</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2183-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Sardina et al. - BMC bioinformatics - INBIA a boosting methodology for proteomic network inference.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2183-5</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30066650</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6069689</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND The analysis of tissue-specific protein interaction networks and their functional enrichment in pathological and normal tissues provides insights on the etiology of diseases. The Pan-cancer proteomic project, in The Cancer Genome Atlas, collects protein expressions in human cancers and it is a reference resource for the functional study of cancers. However, established protocols to infer interaction networks from protein expressions are still missing. RESULTS We have developed a methodology called Inference Network Based on iRefIndex Analysis (INBIA) to accurately correlate proteomic inferred relations to protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. INBIA makes use of 14 network inference methods on protein expressions related to 16 cancer types. It uses as reference model the iRefIndex human PPI network. Predictions are validated through non-interacting and tissue specific PPI networks resources. The first, Negatome, takes into account likely non-interacting proteins by combining both structure properties and literature mining. The latter, TissueNet and GIANT, report experimentally verified PPIs in more than 50 human tissues. The reliability of the proposed methodology is assessed by comparing INBIA with PERA, a tool which infers protein interaction networks from Pathway Commons, by both functional and topological analysis. CONCLUSION Results show that INBIA is a valuable approach to predict proteomic interactions in pathological conditions starting from the current knowledge of human protein interactions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Yuqing</author><author>Jenkins, David F.</author><author>Manimaran, Solaiappan</author><author>Johnson, W.

However, significant technical heterogeneity is commonly observed across multiple batches of data that are generated from different processing or reagent batches, experimenters, protocols, or profiling platforms. These so-called batch effects often confound true biological relationships in the data, reducing the power benefits of combining multiple batches, and may even lead to spurious results in some combined studies. Therefore there is significant need for effective methods and software tools that account for batch effects in high-throughput genomic studies. RESULTS Here we contribute multiple methods and software tools for improved combination and analysis of data from multiple batches. In particular, we provide batch effect solutions for cases where the severity of the batch effects is not extreme, and for cases where one high-quality batch can serve as a reference, such as the training set in a biomarker study. We illustrate our approaches and software in both simulated and real data scenarios. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate the value of these new contributions compared to currently established approaches in the specified batch correction situations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yeganova, Lana</author><author>Kim, Sun</author><author>Balasanov, Grigory</author><author>Wilbur, W.

Two common approaches to provide a broad overview of the information space are document clustering and topic modeling. Clustering aims to group documents or terms into meaningful clusters. Topic modeling, on the other hand, focuses on finding coherent keywords for describing topics appearing in a set of documents. In addition, there have been efforts for clustering documents and finding keywords simultaneously. RESULTS We present an algorithm to analyze document collections that is based on a notion of a theme, defined as a dual representation based on a set of documents and key terms. In this work, a novel vector space mechanism is proposed for computing themes. Starting with a single document, the theme algorithm treats terms and documents as explicit components, and iteratively uses each representation to refine the other until the theme is detected. The method heavily relies on an optimization routine that we refer to as the projection algorithm which, under specific conditions, is guaranteed to converge to the first singular vector of a data matrix. We apply our algorithm to a collection of about sixty thousand PubMed Ⓡ documents examining the subject of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, evaluate the results and show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. CONCLUSIONS This study presents a contribution on theoretical and algorithmic levels, as well as demonstrates the feasibility of the method for large scale applications. The evaluation of our system on benchmark datasets demonstrates that our method compares favorably with the current state-of-the-art methods in computing clusters of documents with coherent topic terms.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Couronné, Raphael</author><author>Probst, Philipp</author><author>Boulesteix, Anne-Laure</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Random forest versus logistic regression: a large-scale benchmark experiment.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>270</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Classification</keyword><keyword>Comparison study</keyword><keyword>Logistic regression</keyword><keyword>Prediction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><accession-num>30016950</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2264-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Couronné, Probst, Boulesteix - BMC bioinformatics - Random forest versus logistic regression a large-scale benchmark experiment.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2264-5</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30016950</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6050737</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND AND GOAL The Random Forest (RF) algorithm for regression and classification has considerably gained popularity since its introduction in 2001. Meanwhile, it has grown to a standard classification approach competing with logistic regression in many innovation-friendly scientific fields. RESULTS In this context, we present a large scale benchmarking experiment based on 243 real datasets comparing the prediction performance of the original version of RF with default parameters and LR as binary classification tools. Most importantly, the design of our benchmark experiment is inspired from clinical trial methodology, thus avoiding common pitfalls and major sources of biases. CONCLUSION RF performed better than LR according to the considered accuracy measured in approximately 69% of the datasets. The mean difference between RF and LR was 0.029 (95%-CI =[0.022,0.038]) for the accuracy, 0.041 (95%-CI =[0.031,0.053]) for the Area Under the Curve, and - 0.027 (95%-CI =[-0.034,-0.021]) for the Brier score, all measures thus suggesting a significantly better performance of RF. As a side-result of our benchmarking experiment, we observed that the results were noticeably dependent on the inclusion criteria used to select the example datasets, thus emphasizing the importance of clear statements regarding this dataset selection process. We also stress that neutral studies similar to ours, based on a high number of datasets and carefully designed, will be necessary in the future to evaluate further variants, implementations or parameters of random forests which may yield improved accuracy compared to the original version with default values.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuśmirek, Wiktor</author><author>Nowak, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>De novo assembly of bacterial genomes with repetitive DNA regions by dnaasm application.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>273</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>De Bruijn graph</keyword><keyword>De novo assembling</keyword><keyword>Next generation sequencing</keyword><keyword>Tandem repeats</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><accession-num>30021513</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2281-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Kuśmirek, Nowak - BMC bioinformatics - De novo assembly of bacterial genomes with repetitive DNA regions by dnaasm application.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2281-4</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021513</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6052550</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Many organisms, in particular bacteria, contain repetitive DNA fragments called tandem repeats. These structures are restored by DNA assemblers by mapping paired-end tags to unitigs, estimating the distance between them and filling the gap with the specified DNA motif, which could be repeated many times. However, some of the tandem repeats are longer than the distance between the paired-end tags. RESULTS We present a new algorithm for de novo DNA assembly, which uses the relative frequency of reads to properly restore tandem repeats. The main advantage of the presented algorithm is that long tandem repeats, which are much longer than maximum reads length and the insert size of paired-end tags can be properly restored. Moreover, repetitive DNA regions covered only by single-read sequencing data could also be restored. Other existing de novo DNA assemblers fail in such cases. The presented application is composed of several steps, including: (i) building the de Bruijn graph, (ii) correcting the de Bruijn graph, (iii) normalizing edge weights, and (iv) generating the output set of DNA sequences. We tested our approach on real data sets of bacterial organisms. CONCLUSIONS The software library, console application and web application were developed. Web application was developed in client-server architecture, where web-browser is used to communicate with end-user and algorithms are implemented in C++ and Python. The presented approach enables proper reconstruction of tandem repeats, which are longer than the insert size of paired-end tags.

Instead, the data are constrained to an arbitrary &quot;library size&quot; by the sequencing depth of the assay, and typically must be normalized prior to statistical analysis. The constrained nature of these data means one could alternatively use a log-ratio transformation in lieu of normalization, as often done when testing for differential abundance (DA) of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in 16S rRNA data. Therefore, we benchmark how well the ALDEx2 package, a transformation-based DA tool, detects differential expression in high-throughput RNA-sequencing data (RNA-Seq), compared to conventional RNA-Seq methods such as edgeR and DESeq2. RESULTS To evaluate the performance of log-ratio transformation-based tools, we apply the ALDEx2 package to two simulated, and two real, RNA-Seq data sets. One of the latter was previously used to benchmark dozens of conventional RNA-Seq differential expression methods, enabling us to directly compare transformation-based approaches. We show that ALDEx2, widely used in meta-genomics research, identifies differentially expressed genes (and transcripts) from RNA-Seq data with high precision and, given sufficient sample sizes, high recall too (regardless of the alignment and quantification procedure used). Although we show that the choice in log-ratio transformation can affect performance, ALDEx2 has high precision (i.e., few false positives) across all transformations. Finally, we present a novel, iterative log-ratio transformation (now implemented in ALDEx2) that further improves performance in simulations. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that log-ratio transformation-based methods can work to measure differential expression from RNA-Seq data, provided that certain assumptions are met. Moreover, these methods have very high precision (i.e., few false positives) in simulations and perform well on real data too. With previously demonstrated applicability to 16S rRNA data, ALDEx2 can thus serve as a single tool for data from multiple sequencing modalities.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stanley, Natalie</author><author>Kwitt, Roland</author><author>Niethammer, Marc</author><author>Mucha, Peter J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Compressing Networks with Super Nodes.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title></periodical><pages>10892</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Computational science</keyword><keyword>Computer science</keyword><keyword>Statistics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>30022035</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-018-29174-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Stanley et al. - Scientific reports - Compressing Networks with Super Nodes.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29174-3</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30022035</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6052167</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Community detection is a commonly used technique for identifying groups in a network based on similarities in connectivity patterns. To facilitate community detection in large networks, we recast the network as a smaller network of 'super nodes', where each super node comprises one or more nodes of the original network. We can then use this super node representation as the input into standard community detection algorithms. To define the seeds, or centers, of our super nodes, we apply the 'CoreHD' ranking, a technique applied in network dismantling and decycling problems. We test our approach through the analysis of two common methods for community detection: modularity maximization with the Louvain algorithm and maximum likelihood optimization for fitting a stochastic block model. Our results highlight that applying community detection to the compressed network of super nodes is significantly faster while successfully producing partitions that are more aligned with the local network connectivity and more stable across multiple (stochastic) runs within and between community detection algorithms, yet still overlap well with the results obtained using the full network.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sawicki, Gregory S</author><author>Khan, Nabil S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Simple Model to Estimate Plantarflexor Muscle-Tendon Mechanics and Energetics During Walking With Elastic Ankle Exoskeletons.</title><secondary-title>IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>914-923</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Biomedical engineering</keyword><keyword>Biomimetics</keyword><keyword>Computer modelling</keyword><keyword>Physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>26485350</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TBME.2015.2491224</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Sawicki, Khan - IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering - A Simple Model to Estimate Plantarflexor Muscle-Tendon Mechanics a.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29429-z</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26485350</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4874912</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>GOAL A recent experiment demonstrated that when humans wear unpowered elastic ankle exoskeletons with intermediate spring stiffness, they can reduce their metabolic energy cost to walk by ∼7%. Springs that are too compliant or too stiff have little benefit. The purpose of this study was to use modeling and simulation to explore the muscle-level mechanisms for the &quot;sweet spot&quot; in stiffness during exoskeleton assisted walking. METHODS We developed a simple lumped uniarticular musculoskeletal model of the plantarflexors operating in parallel with an elastic &quot;exo-tendon.&quot; Using an inverse approach with constrained kinematics and kinetics, we rapidly simulated human walking over a range of exoskeleton stiffness values and examined the underlying neuromechanics and energetics of the biological plantarflexors. RESULTS Stiffer ankle exoskeleton springs resulted in larger decreases in plantarflexor muscle forces, activations, and metabolic energy consumption. However, in the process of unloading the compliant biological muscle-tendon unit, the muscle fascicles experienced larger excursions that negatively impacted series elastic element recoil that is characteristic of a tuned &quot;catapult mechanism.&quot; CONCLUSION The combination of disrupted muscle-tendon dynamics and the need to produce compensatory forces/moments to maintain overall net ankle moment invariance could explain the &quot;sweet spot&quot; in metabolic performance at intermediate ankle exoskeleton stiffness. Future work will aim to provide experimental evidence to support the model predictions presented here using ultrasound imaging of muscle-level dynamics during walking with elastic ankle exoskeletons. SIGNIFICANCE Engineers must account for the muscle-level effects of exoskeleton designs in order to achieve maximal performance objectives.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gollo, Leonardo L.</author><author>Roberts, James A.</author><author>Cropley, Vanessa L.</author><author>Di Biase, Maria A.</author><author>Pantelis, Christos</author><author>Zalesky, Andrew</author><author>Breakspear, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fragility and volatility of structural hubs in the human connectome.</title><secondary-title>Nature neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>1107-1116</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Dynamic networks</keyword><keyword>Network models</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>Stochastic networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><isbn>1097-6256</isbn><accession-num>30038275</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41593-018-0188-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Gollo et al. - Nature neuroscience - Fragility and volatility of structural hubs in the human connectome.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0188-z</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038275</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Brain structure reflects the influence of evolutionary processes that pit the costs of its anatomical wiring against the computational advantages conferred by its complexity. We show that cost-neutral 'mutations' of the human connectome almost inevitably degrade its complexity and disconnect high-strength connections to prefrontal network hubs. Conversely, restoring the peripheral location and strong connectivity of empirically observed hubs confers a wiring cost that the brain appears to minimize. Progressive cost-neutral randomization yields daughter networks that differ substantially from one another and results in a topologically unstable phenomenon consistent with a phase transition in complex systems. The fragility of hubs to disconnection shows a significant association with the acceleration of gray matter loss in schizophrenia. Together with effects on wiring cost, we suggest that fragile prefrontal hub connections and topological volatility act as evolutionary influences on brain networks whose optimal set point may be perturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kobayashi, Teruyoshi</author><author>Sapienza, Anna</author><author>Ferrara, Emilio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extracting the multi-timescale activity patterns of online financial markets.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title></periodical><pages>11184</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Computer science</keyword><keyword>Statistical physics</keyword><keyword>thermodynamics and nonlinear dynamics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>30046150</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-018-29537-w</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Kobayashi, Sapienza, Ferrara - Scientific reports - Extracting the multi-timescale activity patterns of online financial markets.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29537-w</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30046150</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6060124</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Online financial markets can be represented as complex systems where trading dynamics can be captured and characterized at different resolutions and time scales.

Here, we combine genome editing and multi-color live imaging to simultaneously visualize physical enhancer-promoter interaction and transcription at the single-cell level in Drosophila embryos. By examining transcriptional activation of a reporter by the endogenous even-skipped enhancers, which are located 150 kb away, we identify three distinct topological conformation states and measure their transition kinetics. We show that sustained proximity of the enhancer to its target is required for activation. Transcription in turn affects the three-dimensional topology as it enhances the temporal stability of the proximal conformation and is associated with further spatial compaction. Furthermore, the facilitated long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the locus, causing corresponding developmental defects. Our approach offers quantitative insight into the spatial and temporal determinants of long-range gene regulation and their implications for cellular fates.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pelikan, Richard C.</author><author>Kelly, Jennifer A.</author><author>Fu, Yao</author><author>Lareau, Caleb A.</author><author>Tessneer, Kandice L.</author><author>Wiley, Graham B</author><author>Wiley, Mandi M.</author><author>Glenn, Stuart B.</author><author>Harley, John B.</author><author>Guthridge, Joel M.</author><author>James, Judith A.</author><author>Aryee, Martin J.</author><author>Montgomery, Courtney</author><author>Gaffney, Patrick M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancer histone-QTLs are enriched on autoimmune risk haplotypes and influence gene expression within chromatin networks.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>2905</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Autoimmune diseases</keyword><keyword>Chromatin structure</keyword><keyword>Epigenomics</keyword><keyword>Quantitative trait loci</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><isbn>4146701805</isbn><accession-num>30046115</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-018-05328-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Pelikan et al. - Nature communications - Enhancer histone-QTLs are enriched on autoimmune risk haplotypes and influence gene expr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05328-9</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30046115</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6060153</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Genetic variants can confer risk to complex genetic diseases by modulating gene expression through changes to the epigenome. To assess the degree to which genetic variants influence epigenome activity, we integrate epigenetic and genotypic data from lupus patient lymphoblastoid cell lines to identify variants that induce allelic imbalance in the magnitude of histone post-translational modifications, referred to herein as histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs). We demonstrate that enhancer hQTLs are enriched on autoimmune disease risk haplotypes and disproportionately influence gene expression variability compared with non-hQTL variants in strong linkage disequilibrium. We show that the epigenome regulates HLA class II genes differently in individuals who carry HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR15 haplotypes, resulting in differential 3D chromatin conformation and gene expression. Finally, we identify significant expression QTL (eQTL) x hQTL interactions that reveal substructure within eQTL gene expression, suggesting potential implications for functional genomic studies that leverage eQTL data for subject selection and stratification.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fasterius, Erik</author><author>Al-Khalili Szigyarto, Cristina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of public RNA-sequencing data reveals biological consequences of genetic heterogeneity in cell line populations.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title></periodical><pages>11226</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Databases</keyword><keyword>RNA sequencing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>30046134</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-018-29506-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Fasterius, Al-Khalili Szigyarto - Scientific reports - Analysis of public RNA-sequencing data reveals biological consequences of.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29506-3</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30046134</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6060100</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Meta-analysis of datasets available in public repositories are used to gather and summarise experiments performed across laboratories, as well as to explore consistency of scientific findings. As data quality and biological equivalency across samples may obscure such analyses and consequently their conclusions, we investigated the comparability of 85 public RNA-seq cell line datasets. Thousands of pairwise comparisons of single nucleotide variants in 139 samples revealed variable genetic heterogeneity of the eight cell line populations analysed as well as variable data quality. The H9 and HCT116 cell lines were found to be remarkably stable across laboratories (with median concordances of 99.2% and 98.5%, respectively), in contrast to the highly variable HeLa cells (89.3%). We show that the genetic heterogeneity encountered greatly affects gene expression between same-cell comparisons, highlighting the importance of interrogating the biological equivalency of samples when comparing experimental datasets. Both the number of differentially expressed genes and the expression levels negatively correlate with the genetic heterogeneity. Finally, we demonstrate how comparing genetically heterogeneous datasets affect gene expression analyses and that high dissimilarity between same-cell datasets alters the expression of more than 300 cancer-related genes, which are often the focus of studies using cell lines.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patten, Darren K.</author><author>Corleone, Giacomo</author><author>Győrffy, Balázs</author><author>Perone, Ylenia</author><author>Slaven, Neil</author><author>Barozzi, Iros</author><author>Erdős, Edina</author><author>Saiakhova, Alina</author><author>Goddard, Kate</author><author>Vingiani, Andrea</author><author>Shousha, Sami</author><author>Pongor, Lőrinc Sándor</author><author>Hadjiminas, Dimitri J.</author><author>Schiavon, Gaia</author><author>Barry, Peter</author><author>Palmieri, Carlo</author><author>Coombes, Raul C.</author><author>Scacheri, Peter</author><author>Pruneri, Giancarlo</author><author>Magnani, Luca</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancer mapping uncovers phenotypic heterogeneity and evolution in patients with luminal breast cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nature medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1469-1480</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Breast cancer</keyword><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Computational models</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><isbn>0288540530</isbn><accession-num>30038216</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41591-018-0091-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Patten et al. - Nature medicine - Enhancer mapping uncovers phenotypic heterogeneity and evolution in patients with luminal breas.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0091-x</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038216</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6130800</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The degree of intrinsic and interpatient phenotypic heterogeneity and its role in tumor evolution is poorly understood. Phenotypic drifts can be transmitted via inheritable transcriptional programs. Cell-type specific transcription is maintained through the activation of epigenetically defined regulatory regions including promoters and enhancers. Here we have annotated the epigenome of 47 primary and metastatic estrogen-receptor (ERα)-positive breast cancer clinical specimens and inferred phenotypic heterogeneity from the regulatory landscape, identifying key regulatory elements commonly shared across patients. Shared regions contain a unique set of regulatory information including the motif for transcription factor YY1. We identify YY1 as a critical determinant of ERα transcriptional activity promoting tumor growth in most luminal patients. YY1 also contributes to the expression of genes mediating resistance to endocrine treatment. Finally, we used H3K27ac levels at active enhancer elements as a surrogate of intra-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity to track the expansion and contraction of phenotypic subpopulations throughout breast cancer progression. By tracking the clonality of SLC9A3R1-positive cells, a bona fide YY1-ERα-regulated gene, we show that endocrine therapies select for phenotypic clones under-represented at diagnosis. Collectively, our data show that epigenetic mechanisms significantly contribute to phenotypic heterogeneity and evolution in systemically treated breast cancer patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cao, Zhen</author><author>Pan, Xiaoyong</author><author>Yang, Yang</author><author>Huang, Yan</author><author>Shen, Hong-Bin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The lncLocator: a subcellular localization predictor for long non-coding RNAs based on a stacked ensemble classifier.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>2185-2194</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1367-4811 (Electronic) 1367-4803 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>29462250</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bty085</electronic-resource-num><notes>predict the subcellular location of lncRNA

Recent studies have shown that their subcellular localizations carry important information for understanding their complex biological functions. Considering the costly and time-consuming experiments for identifying subcellular localization of lncRNAs, computational methods are urgently desired. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no computational tools for predicting the lncRNA subcellular locations to date. Results In this study, we report an ensemble classifier-based predictor, lncLocator, for predicting the lncRNA subcellular localizations. To fully exploit lncRNA sequence information, we adopt both k-mer features and high-level abstraction features generated by unsupervised deep models, and construct four classifiers by feeding these two types of features to support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), respectively. Then we use a stacked ensemble strategy to combine the four classifiers and get the final prediction results. The current lncLocator can predict five subcellular localizations of lncRNAs, including cytoplasm, nucleus, cytosol, ribosome and exosome, and yield an overall accuracy of 0.59 on the constructed benchmark dataset.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can comprise the majority (&gt;85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation. Results Methods that align RNA-seq reads to a diploid transcriptome incorporating known genetic variants improve estimates of ASE and total gene expression compared to methods that use reference genome alignments. Weighted allocation methods outperform methods that discard multi-reads. Hierarchical allocation of reads improves estimation of ASE even when data are simulated from a non-hierarchical model. Analysis of RNA-seq data from F1 hybrid mice using EMASE reveals widespread ASE associated with cis-acting polymorphisms and a small number of parent-of-origin effects.

High-throughput peptide mass fingerprinting has been largely applied to bacterial identification, but increasingly used to identify archaeological and palaeontological skeletal material to yield information on past environments and human-animal interaction. However, as applications move away from predominantly domesticate and the more abundant wild fauna to a much wider range of less common taxa that do not yet have genetically-derived sequence information, robust methods of species identification and biomarker selection need to be determined. RESULTS Here we developed a supervised machine learning algorithm for classifying the species of ancient remains based on collagen fingerprinting. The aim was to minimise requirements on prior knowledge of known species while yielding satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm uses iterations of a modified random forest classifier with a similarity scoring system to expand its identified samples. We tested it on a set of 6805 spectra and found that a high level of accuracy can be achieved with a training set of five identified specimens per taxon. CONCLUSIONS This method consistently achieves higher accuracy than two-dimensional principal component analysis and similar accuracy with hierarchical clustering using optimised parameters, which greatly reduces requirements for human input. Within the vertebrata, we demonstrate that this method was able to achieve the taxonomic resolution of family or sub-family level whereas the genus- or species-level identification may require manual interpretation or further experiments. In addition, it also identifies additional species biomarkers than those previously published.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Veiga, Rafael V.</author><author>Barbosa, Helio J.

They are complex diseases with strong contextual influence, so that the use of advanced machine learning tools such as genetic programming could be important for the understanding the causal mechanisms explaining those conditions. Here, we applied a multiobjective grammar-based genetic programming (MGGP) to a dataset composed by 1047 subjects. The dataset contains information on the environmental, psychosocial, socioeconomics, nutritional and infectious factors collected from participating children. The objective of this work is to generate models that explain the occurrence of asthma, and two markers of allergy: presence of IgE antibody against common allergens, and skin prick test positivity for common allergens (SPT). RESULTS The average of the accuracies of the models for asthma higher in MGGP than C4.5. IgE were higher in MGGP than in both, logistic regression and C4.5. MGGP had levels of accuracy similar to RF, but unlike RF, MGGP was able to generate models that were easy to interpret. CONCLUSIONS MGGP has shown that infections, psychosocial, nutritional, hygiene, and socioeconomic factors may be related in such an intricate way, that could be hardly detected using traditional regression based epidemiological techniques.

Finding non-overlapping motif instances is however a computationally challenging task. The fact that biological interactions are uncertain events further complicates the problem, as it makes the existence of an embedding of a given motif an uncertain event as well. RESULTS In this paper, we develop a novel method, ProMotE (Probabilistic Motif Embedding), to count non-overlapping embeddings of a given motif in probabilistic networks. We utilize a polynomial model to capture the uncertainty. We develop three strategies to scale our algorithm to large networks. CONCLUSIONS Our experiments demonstrate that our method scales to large networks in practical time with high accuracy where existing methods fail. Moreover, our experiments on cancer and degenerative disease networks show that our method helps in uncovering key functional characteristics of biological networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clarke, Thomas H.</author><author>Brinkac, Lauren M.</author><author>Inman, Jason M.</author><author>Sutton, Granger</author><author>Fouts, Derrick E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PanACEA: a bioinformatics tool for the exploration and visualization of bacterial pan-chromosomes.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>246</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Pan-chromosome</keyword><keyword>Pan-genome</keyword><keyword>PanOCT</keyword><keyword>Viewer</keyword><keyword>Visualization</keyword><keyword>fGI</keyword><keyword>fGR</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><isbn>1471-2105 (Electronic) 1471-2105 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>29945570</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2250-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Clarke et al. - BMC bioinformatics - PanACEA a bioinformatics tool for the exploration and visualization of bacterial pan-chromos.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2250-y</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29945570</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6020400</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Bacterial pan-genomes, comprised of conserved and variable genes across multiple sequenced bacterial genomes, allow for identification of genomic regions that are phylogenetically discriminating or functionally important. Pan-genomes consist of large amounts of data, which can restrict researchers ability to locate and analyze these regions. Multiple software packages are available to visualize pan-genomes, but currently their ability to address these concerns are limited by using only pre-computed data sets, prioritizing core over variable gene clusters, or by not accounting for pan-chromosome positioning in the viewer. RESULTS We introduce PanACEA (Pan-genome Atlas with Chromosome Explorer and Analyzer), which utilizes locally-computed interactive web-pages to view ordered pan-genome data. It consists of multi-tiered, hierarchical display pages that extend from pan-chromosomes to both core and variable regions to single genes. Regions and genes are functionally annotated to allow for rapid searching and visual identification of regions of interest with the option that user-supplied genomic phylogenies and metadata can be incorporated. PanACEA's memory and time requirements are within the capacities of standard laptops. The capability of PanACEA as a research tool is demonstrated by highlighting a variable region important in differentiating strains of Enterobacter hormaechei. CONCLUSIONS PanACEA can rapidly translate the results of pan-chromosome programs into an intuitive and interactive visual representation. It will empower researchers to visually explore and identify regions of the pan-chromosome that are most biologically interesting, and to obtain publication quality images of these regions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iuchi, Hitoshi</author><author>Sugimoto, Masahiro</author><author>Tomita, Masaru</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MICOP: Maximal information coefficient-based oscillation prediction to detect biological rhythms in proteomics data</title><secondary-title>BMC Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>249</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Computational Biology/Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Computer Appl. in Life Sciences</keyword><keyword>Microarrays</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2257-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Iuchi, Sugimoto, Tomita - BMC Bioinformatics - MICOP Maximal information coefficient-based oscillation prediction to detect biolo.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2257-4</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Circadian rhythms comprise oscillating molecular interactions, the disruption of the homeostasis of which would cause various disorders. To understand this phenomenon systematically, an accurate technique to identify oscillating molecules among omics datasets must be developed; however, this is still impeded by many difficulties, such as experimental noise and attenuated amplitude. To address these issues, we developed a new algorithm named Maximal Information Coefficient-based Oscillation Prediction (MICOP), a sine curve-matching method. The performance of MICOP in labeling oscillation or non-oscillation was compared with four reported methods using Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) values. The numerical experiments were performed with time-series data with (1) mimicking of molecular oscillation decay, (2) high noise and low sampling frequency and (3) one-cycle data. The first experiment revealed that MICOP could accurately identify the rhythmicity of decaying molecular oscillation (MCC &gt; 0.7). The second experiment revealed that MICOP was robust against high-level noise (MCC &gt; 0.8) even upon the use of low-sampling-frequency data. The third experiment revealed that MICOP could accurately identify the rhythmicity of noisy one-cycle data (MCC &gt; 0.8). As an application, we utilized MICOP to analyze time-series proteome data of mouse liver. MICOP identified that novel oscillating candidates numbered 14 and 30 for C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 J, respectively. In this paper, we presented MICOP, which is an MIC-based algorithm, for predicting periodic patterns in large-scale time-resolved protein expression profiles. The performance test using artificially generated simulation data revealed that the performance of MICOP for decaying data was superior to that of the existing widely used methods. It can reveal novel findings from time-series data and may contribute to biologically significant results. This study suggests that MICOP is an ideal approach for detecting and characterizing oscillations in time-resolved omics data sets.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bachman, John A.</author><author>Gyori, Benjamin M.</author><author>Sorger, Peter K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FamPlex: a resource for entity recognition and relationship resolution of human protein families and complexes in biomedical text mining.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>248</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Biocuration</keyword><keyword>Event extraction</keyword><keyword>Grounding</keyword><keyword>Named entity linking</keyword><keyword>Named entity recognition</keyword><keyword>Natural language processing</keyword><keyword>Protein families</keyword><keyword>Text mining</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central</publisher><isbn>14712105 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>29954318</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2211-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Bachman, Gyori, Sorger - BMC bioinformatics - FamPlex a resource for entity recognition and relationship resolution of human prot.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2211-5</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29954318</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6022344</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND For automated reading of scientific publications to extract useful information about molecular mechanisms it is critical that genes, proteins and other entities be correctly associated with uniform identifiers, a process known as named entity linking or &quot;grounding.&quot; Correct grounding is essential for resolving relationships among mined information, curated interaction databases, and biological datasets. The accuracy of this process is largely dependent on the availability of machine-readable resources associating synonyms and abbreviations commonly found in biomedical literature with uniform identifiers. RESULTS In a task involving automated reading of ∼215,000 articles using the REACH event extraction software we found that grounding was disproportionately inaccurate for multi-protein families (e.g., &quot;AKT&quot;) and complexes with multiple subunits (e.g.&quot;NF- κB&quot;). To address this problem we constructed FamPlex, a manually curated resource defining protein families and complexes as they are commonly encountered in biomedical text. In FamPlex the gene-level constituents of families and complexes are defined in a flexible format allowing for multi-level, hierarchical membership. To create FamPlex, text strings corresponding to entities were identified empirically from literature and linked manually to uniform identifiers; these identifiers were also mapped to equivalent entries in multiple related databases. FamPlex also includes curated prefix and suffix patterns that improve named entity recognition and event extraction. Evaluation of REACH extractions on a test corpus of ∼54,000 articles showed that FamPlex significantly increased grounding accuracy for families and complexes (from 15 to 71%). The hierarchical organization of entities in FamPlex also made it possible to integrate otherwise unconnected mechanistic information across families, subfamilies, and individual proteins. Applications of FamPlex to the TRIPS/DRUM reading system and the Biocreative VI Bioentity Normalization Task dataset demonstrated the utility of FamPlex in other settings. CONCLUSION FamPlex is an effective resource for improving named entity recognition, grounding, and relationship resolution in automated reading of biomedical text. The content in FamPlex is available in both tabular and Open Biomedical Ontology formats at https://github.com/sorgerlab/famplex under the Creative Commons CC0 license and has been integrated into the TRIPS/DRUM and REACH reading systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Letouzé, Eric</author><author>Shinde, Jayendra</author><author>Renault, Victor</author><author>Couchy, Gabrielle</author><author>Blanc, Jean-Frédéric</author><author>Tubacher, Emmanuel</author><author>Bayard, Quentin</author><author>Bacq, Delphine</author><author>Meyer, Vincent</author><author>Semhoun, Jérémy</author><author>Bioulac-Sage, Paulette</author><author>Prévôt, Sophie</author><author>Azoulay, Daniel</author><author>Paradis, Valérie</author><author>Imbeaud, Sandrine</author><author>Deleuze, Jean-François</author><author>Zucman-Rossi, Jessica</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutational signatures reveal the dynamic interplay of risk factors and cellular processes during liver tumorigenesis.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1315</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>2041-1723</isbn><accession-num>29101368</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-017-01358-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Letouzé et al. - Nature communications - Mutational signatures reveal the dynamic interplay of risk factors and cellular process.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www-nature-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/articles/s41467-017-01358-x.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29101368</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5670220</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Genomic alterations driving tumorigenesis result from the interaction of environmental exposures and endogenous cellular processes. With a diversity of risk factors, liver cancer is an ideal model to study these interactions. Here, we analyze the whole genomes of 44 new and 264 published liver cancers and we identify 10 mutational and 6 structural rearrangement signatures showing distinct relationships with environmental exposures, replication, transcription, and driver genes. The liver cancer-specific signature 16, associated with alcohol, displays a unique feature of transcription-coupled damage and is the main source of CTNNB1 mutations. Flood of insertions/deletions (indels) are identified in very highly expressed hepato-specific genes, likely resulting from replication-transcription collisions. Reconstruction of sub-clonal architecture reveals mutational signature evolution during tumor development exemplified by the vanishing of aflatoxin B1 signature in African migrants. Finally, chromosome duplications occur late and may represent rate-limiting events in tumorigenesis. These findings shed new light on the natural history of liver cancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Díaz-Gay, Marcos</author><author>Vila-Casadesús, Maria</author><author>Franch-Expósito, Sebastià</author><author>Hernández-Illán, Eva</author><author>Lozano, Juan José</author><author>Castellví-Bel, Sergi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutational Signatures in Cancer (MuSiCa): a web application to implement mutational signatures analysis in cancer samples.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>224</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>COSMIC database</keyword><keyword>Cancer genomics</keyword><keyword>Mutational signatures</keyword><keyword>R language</keyword><keyword>Shiny</keyword><keyword>Single nucleotide variants</keyword><keyword>Web tool</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29898651</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-018-2234-y</electronic-resource-num><notes>The web app claims to be able evaluate targeted sequencing data, but I don't see anything in the MutationalPatterns package for that implementation.

Up to now, several bioinformatic packages to address this topic have been developed in different languages/platforms. MutationalPatterns has arisen as the most efficient tool for the comparison with the signatures currently reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. However, the analysis of mutational signatures is nowadays restricted to a small community of bioinformatic experts. RESULTS In this work we present Mutational Signatures in Cancer (MuSiCa), a new web tool based on MutationalPatterns and built using the Shiny framework in R language. By means of a simple interface suited to non-specialized researchers, it provides a comprehensive analysis of the somatic mutational status of the supplied cancer samples. It permits characterizing the profile and burden of mutations, as well as quantifying COSMIC-reported mutational signatures. It also allows classifying samples according to the above signature contributions. CONCLUSIONS MuSiCa is a helpful web application to characterize mutational signatures in cancer samples. It is accessible online at http://bioinfo.ciberehd.org/GPtoCRC/en/tools.html and source code is freely available at https://github.com/marcos-diazg/musica .</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lux, Markus</author><author>Brinkman, Ryan Remy</author><author>Chauve, Cedric</author><author>Laing, Adam</author><author>Lorenc, Anna</author><author>Abeler-Dörner, Lucie</author><author>Hammer, Barbara</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Wren, Jonathan</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>flowLearn: Fast and precise identification and quality checking of cell populations in flow cytometry.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>2245-2253</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29462241</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bty082</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Lux et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - flowLearn Fast and precise identification and quality checking of cell population.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://watermark.silverchair.com/bty082.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAeUwggHhBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggHSMIIBzgIBADCCAccGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMpem8KGeKGenUb8CCAgEQgIIBmBWiF_QUrxe9Ff03BCjF8SHfAFaKi04ubhMFTPk-LKySDN7B</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation Identification of cell populations in flow cytometry is a critical part of the analysis and lays the groundwork for many applications and research discovery. The current paradigm of manual analysis is time consuming and subjective. A common goal of users is to replace manual analysis with automated methods that replicate their results. Supervised tools provide the best performance in such a use case, however they require fine parameterization to obtain the best results. Hence, there is a strong need for methods that are fast to setup, accurate and interpretable. Results flowLearn is a semi-supervised approach for the quality-checked identification of cell populations. Using a very small number of manually gated samples, through density alignments it is able to predict gates on other samples with high accuracy and speed. On two state-of-the-art data sets, our tool achieves median(F1)-measures exceeding 0.99 for 31%, and 0.90 for 80% of all analyzed populations. Furthermore, users can directly interpret and adjust automated gates on new sample files to iteratively improve the initial training.

Here we analyse systematically more than 70 pairs of primary human colon tumours by applying next-generation sequencing to characterize their exomes, transcriptomes and copy-number alterations. We have identified 36,303 protein-altering somatic changes that include several new recurrent mutations in the Wnt pathway gene TCF7L2, chromatin-remodelling genes such as TET2 and TET3 and receptor tyrosine kinases including ERBB3. Our analysis for significantly mutated cancer genes identified 23 candidates, including the cell cycle checkpoint kinase ATM. Copy-number and RNA-seq data analysis identified amplifications and corresponding overexpression of IGF2 in a subset of colon tumours. Furthermore, using RNA-seq data we identified multiple fusion transcripts including recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin family members RSPO2 and RSPO3 that together occur in 10% of colon tumours. The RSPO fusions were mutually exclusive with APC mutations, indicating that they probably have a role in the activation of Wnt signalling and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this we show that the RSPO fusion proteins were capable of potentiating Wnt signalling. The R-spondin gene fusions and several other gene mutations identified in this study provide new potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention in colon cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rosenthal, Rachel</author><author>McGranahan, Nicholas</author><author>Herrero, Javier</author><author>Taylor, Barry S</author><author>Swanton, Charles</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DeconstructSigs: delineating mutational processes in single tumors distinguishes DNA repair deficiencies and patterns of carcinoma evolution.</title><secondary-title>Genome biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome biology</full-title></periodical><pages>31</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>APOBEC</keyword><keyword>Esophageal carcinoma</keyword><keyword>Mutational signatures</keyword><keyword>Single samples</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1756-994X (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>26899170</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13059-016-0893-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Rosenthal et al. - Genome biology - DeconstructSigs delineating mutational processes in single tumors distinguishes DNA repair de.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13059-016-0893-4</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26899170</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4762164</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Analysis of somatic mutations provides insight into the mutational processes that have shaped the cancer genome, but such analysis currently requires large cohorts.

A cancer genome bears the cumulative effects of mutational processes during tumor development. Deciphering mutational signatures in cancer is a new topic in cancer research. The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) has categorized 30 reference signatures in the COSMIC database based on the analyses of ∼10 000 sequencing datasets from TCGA and ICGC. Large cohorts and bioinformatics skills are required to perform the same analysis as WTSI. The quantification of known signatures in custom cohorts is not possible under the current framework of the COSMIC database, which motivates us to construct a database for mutational signatures in cancers and make such analyses more accessible to general researchers. mSignatureDB (http://tardis.cgu.edu.tw/msignaturedb) integrates R packages and in-house scripts to determine the contributions of the published signatures in 15 780 individual tumors from 73 TCGA/ICGC cancer projects, making comparison of signature patterns within and between projects become possible. mSignatureDB also allows users to perform signature analysis on their own datasets, quantifying contributions of signatures at sample resolution, which is a unique feature of mSignatureDB not available in other related databases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guney, Emre</author><author>Oliva, Baldo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploiting protein-protein interaction networks for genome-wide disease-gene prioritization.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e43557</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>1932-6203 (Electronic)\r1932-6203 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>23028459</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0043557</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Guney, Oliva - PloS one - Exploiting protein-protein interaction networks for genome-wide disease-gene prioritization.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043557&amp;type=printable</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23028459</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3448640</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Complex genetic disorders often involve products of multiple genes acting cooperatively. Hence, the pathophenotype is the outcome of the perturbations in the underlying pathways, where gene products cooperate through various mechanisms such as protein-protein interactions. Pinpointing the decisive elements of such disease pathways is still challenging. Over the last years, computational approaches exploiting interaction network topology have been successfully applied to prioritize individual genes involved in diseases. Although linkage intervals provide a list of disease-gene candidates, recent genome-wide studies demonstrate that genes not associated with any known linkage interval may also contribute to the disease phenotype. Network based prioritization methods help highlighting such associations. Still, there is a need for robust methods that capture the interplay among disease-associated genes mediated by the topology of the network. Here, we propose a genome-wide network-based prioritization framework named GUILD. This framework implements four network-based disease-gene prioritization algorithms. We analyze the performance of these algorithms in dozens of disease phenotypes. The algorithms in GUILD are compared to state-of-the-art network topology based algorithms for prioritization of genes. As a proof of principle, we investigate top-ranking genes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), diabetes and AIDS using disease-gene associations from various sources. We show that GUILD is able to significantly highlight disease-gene associations that are not used a priori. Our findings suggest that GUILD helps to identify genes implicated in the pathology of human disorders independent of the loci associated with the disorders.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Warde-Farley, David</author><author>Donaldson, Sylva L.</author><author>Comes, Ovi</author><author>Zuberi, Khalid</author><author>Badrawi, Rashad</author><author>Chao, Pauline</author><author>Franz, Max</author><author>Grouios, Chris</author><author>Kazi, Farzana</author><author>Lopes, Christian Tannus</author><author>Maitland, Anson</author><author>Mostafavi, Sara</author><author>Montojo, Jason</author><author>Shao, Quentin</author><author>Wright, George</author><author>Bader, Gary D.</author><author>Morris, Quaid</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The GeneMANIA prediction server: biological network integration for gene prioritization and predicting gene function.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>W214-20</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>Web Server issue</issue><keywords><keyword>arabidopsis</keyword><keyword>datasets</keyword><keyword>mice</keyword><keyword>yeasts</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher><isbn>1362-4962 (Electronic)\r0305-1048 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>20576703</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkq537</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Warde-Farley et al. - Nucleic acids research - The GeneMANIA prediction server biological network integration for gene prioritiza.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/nar/gkq537</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20576703</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2896186</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>GeneMANIA (http://www.genemania.org) is a flexible, user-friendly web interface for generating hypotheses about gene function, analyzing gene lists and prioritizing genes for functional assays.

GeneMANIA also reports weights that indicate the predictive value of each selected data set for the query. Six organisms are currently supported (Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and hundreds of data sets have been collected from GEO, BioGRID, Pathway Commons and I2D, as well as organism-specific functional genomics data sets. Users can select arbitrary subsets of the data sets associated with an organism to perform their analyses and can upload their own data sets to analyze.

Because network-based gene prioritization algorithms are based on propagating information of known phenotype-associated genes through networks, the pathway structure of each phenotype might significantly affect the effectiveness of algorithms. We systematically compared two popular network algorithms with distinct mechanisms--direct neighborhood which propagates information to only direct network neighbors, and network diffusion which diffuses information throughout the entire network--in prioritization of genes for worm and human phenotypes. Previous studies reported that network diffusion generally outperforms direct neighborhood for human diseases. Although prioritization power is generally measured for all ranked genes, only the top candidates are significant for subsequent functional analysis. We found that high prioritizing power of a network algorithm for all genes cannot guarantee successful prioritization of top ranked candidates for a given phenotype. Indeed, the majority of the phenotypes that were more efficiently prioritized by network diffusion showed higher prioritizing power for top candidates by direct neighborhood. We also found that connectivity among pathway genes for each phenotype largely determines which network algorithm is more effective, suggesting that the network algorithm used for each phenotype should be chosen with consideration of pathway gene connectivity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wood, Laura D</author><author>Parsons, D Williams</author><author>Jones, Siân</author><author>Lin, Jimmy</author><author>Sjöblom, Tobias</author><author>Leary, Rebecca J</author><author>Shen, Dong</author><author>Boca, Simina M</author><author>Barber, Thomas</author><author>Ptak, Janine</author><author>Silliman, Natalie</author><author>Szabo, Steve</author><author>Dezso, Zoltan</author><author>Ustyanksky, Vadim</author><author>Nikolskaya, Tatiana</author><author>Nikolsky, Yuri</author><author>Karchin, Rachel</author><author>Wilson, Paul A</author><author>Kaminker, Joshua S</author><author>Zhang, Zemin</author><author>Croshaw, Randal</author><author>Willis, Joseph</author><author>Dawson, Dawn</author><author>Shipitsin, Michail</author><author>Willson, James K V</author><author>Sukumar, Saraswati</author><author>Polyak, Kornelia</author><author>Park, Ben Ho</author><author>Pethiyagoda, Charit L</author><author>Pant, P V Krishna</author><author>Ballinger, Dennis G</author><author>Sparks, Andrew B</author><author>Hartigan, James</author><author>Smith, Douglas R</author><author>Suh, Erick</author><author>Papadopoulos, Nickolas</author><author>Buckhaults, Phillip</author><author>Markowitz, Sanford D</author><author>Parmigiani, Giovanni</author><author>Kinzler, Kenneth W</author><author>Velculescu, Victor E</author><author>Vogelstein, Bert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The genomic landscapes of human breast and colorectal cancers.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>1108-13</pages><volume>318</volume><issue>5853</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><publisher>American Association for the Advancement of Science</publisher><isbn>1095-9203 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>17932254</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1145720</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Wood et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - The genomic landscapes of human breast and colorectal cancers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17932254</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Human cancer is caused by the accumulation of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. To catalog the genetic changes that occur during tumorigenesis, we isolated DNA from 11 breast and 11 colorectal tumors and determined the sequences of the genes in the Reference Sequence database in these samples. Based on analysis of exons representing 20,857 transcripts from 18,191 genes, we conclude that the genomic landscapes of breast and colorectal cancers are composed of a handful of commonly mutated gene &quot;mountains&quot; and a much larger number of gene &quot;hills&quot; that are mutated at low frequency. We describe statistical and bioinformatic tools that may help identify mutations with a role in tumorigenesis. These results have implications for understanding the nature and heterogeneity of human cancers and for using personal genomics for tumor diagnosis and therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hill, Steven M</author><author>Lu, Yiling</author><author>Molina, Jennifer</author><author>Heiser, Laura M</author><author>Spellman, Paul T</author><author>Speed, Terence P</author><author>Gray, Joe W</author><author>Mills, Gordon B</author><author>Mukherjee, Sach</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bayesian inference of signaling network topology in a cancer cell line.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>2804-10</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>1367-4803\r1460-2059</isbn><accession-num>22923301</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bts514</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Hill et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Bayesian inference of signaling network topology in a cancer cell line.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://watermark.silverchair.com/bts514.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAdwwggHYBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggHJMIIBxQIBADCCAb4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMB0EIiF9OkPXfrf2vAgEQgIIBj9LAj8L_FL_88AqTFfjmyLmvnbgUQVxPMzyu_Yinq7yPkciF</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MOTIVATION Protein signaling networks play a key role in cellular function, and their dysregulation is central to many diseases, including cancer. To shed light on signaling network topology in specific contexts, such as cancer, requires interrogation of multiple proteins through time and statistical approaches to make inferences regarding network structure. RESULTS In this study, we use dynamic Bayesian networks to make inferences regarding network structure and thereby generate testable hypotheses. We incorporate existing biology using informative network priors, weighted objectively by an empirical Bayes approach, and exploit a connection between variable selection and network inference to enable exact calculation of posterior probabilities of interest. The approach is computationally efficient and essentially free of user-set tuning parameters. Results on data where the true, underlying network is known place the approach favorably relative to existing approaches. We apply these methods to reverse-phase protein array time-course data from a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468) to predict signaling links that we independently validate using targeted inhibition. The methods proposed offer a general approach by which to elucidate molecular networks specific to biological context, including, but not limited to, human cancers.

Toward this goal, we describe a method called PARADIGM-SHIFT that can predict whether a mutational event is neutral, gain-or loss-of-function in a tumor sample. The method uses a belief-propagation algorithm to infer gene activity from gene expression and copy number data in the context of a set of pathway interactions. RESULTS The method was found to be both sensitive and specific on a set of positive and negative controls for multiple cancers for which pathway information was available. Application to the Cancer Genome Atlas glioblastoma, ovarian and lung squamous cancer datasets revealed several novel mutations with predicted high impact including several genes mutated at low frequency suggesting the approach will be complementary to current approaches that rely on the prevalence of events to reach statistical significance.

New technologies allow for the simultaneous genome-wide assay of the state of genome copy number variation, gene expression, DNA methylation and epigenetics of tumor samples and cancer cell lines. Analyses of current data sets find that genetic alterations between patients can differ but often involve common pathways. It is therefore critical to identify relevant pathways involved in cancer progression and detect how they are altered in different patients. RESULTS We present a novel method for inferring patient-specific genetic activities incorporating curated pathway interactions among genes. A gene is modeled by a factor graph as a set of interconnected variables encoding the expression and known activity of a gene and its products, allowing the incorporation of many types of omic data as evidence. The method predicts the degree to which a pathway's activities (e.g. internal gene states, interactions or high-level 'outputs') are altered in the patient using probabilistic inference. Compared with a competing pathway activity inference approach called SPIA, our method identifies altered activities in cancer-related pathways with fewer false-positives in both a glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and a breast cancer dataset. PARADIGM identified consistent pathway-level activities for subsets of the GBM patients that are overlooked when genes are considered in isolation. Further, grouping GBM patients based on their significant pathway perturbations divides them into clinically-relevant subgroups having significantly different survival outcomes. These findings suggest that therapeutics might be chosen that target genes at critical points in the commonly perturbed pathway(s) of a group of patients.

We perform a pan-cancer analysis of mutated networks in 3,281 samples from 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using HotNet2, a new algorithm to find mutated subnetworks that overcomes the limitations of existing single-gene, pathway and network approaches. We identify 16 significantly mutated subnetworks that comprise well-known cancer signaling pathways as well as subnetworks with less characterized roles in cancer, including cohesin, condensin and others. Many of these subnetworks exhibit co-occurring mutations across samples. These subnetworks contain dozens of genes with rare somatic mutations across multiple cancers; many of these genes have additional evidence supporting a role in cancer. By illuminating these rare combinations of mutations, pan-cancer network analyses provide a roadmap to investigate new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities across cancer types.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krallinger, Martin</author><author>Vazquez, Miguel</author><author>Leitner, Florian</author><author>Salgado, David</author><author>Chatr-Aryamontri, Andrew</author><author>Winter, Andrew</author><author>Perfetto, Livia</author><author>Briganti, Leonardo</author><author>Licata, Luana</author><author>Iannuccelli, Marta</author><author>Castagnoli, Luisa</author><author>Cesareni, Gianni</author><author>Tyers, Mike</author><author>Schneider, Gerold</author><author>Rinaldi, Fabio</author><author>Leaman, Robert</author><author>Gonzalez, Graciela</author><author>Matos, Sergio</author><author>Kim, Sun</author><author>Wilbur, W.

The BioCreative III Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) tasks were motivated by such considerations, trying to address aspects including how the end user would oversee the generated output, for instance by providing ranked results, textual evidence for human interpretation or measuring time savings by using automated systems. Detecting articles describing complex biological events like PPIs was addressed in the Article Classification Task (ACT), where participants were asked to implement tools for detecting PPI-describing abstracts. Therefore the BCIII-ACT corpus was provided, which includes a training, development and test set of over 12,000 PPI relevant and non-relevant PubMed abstracts labeled manually by domain experts and recording also the human classification times. The Interaction Method Task (IMT) went beyond abstracts and required mining for associations between more than 3,500 full text articles and interaction detection method ontology concepts that had been applied to detect the PPIs reported in them. RESULTS A total of 11 teams participated in at least one of the two PPI tasks (10 in ACT and 8 in the IMT) and a total of 62 persons were involved either as participants or in preparing data sets/evaluating these tasks. Per task, each team was allowed to submit five runs offline and another five online via the BioCreative Meta-Server. From the 52 runs submitted for the ACT, the highest Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score measured was 0.55 at an accuracy of 89% and the best AUC iP/R was 68%. Most ACT teams explored machine learning methods, some of them also used lexical resources like MeSH terms, PSI-MI concepts or particular lists of verbs and nouns, some integrated NER approaches. For the IMT, a total of 42 runs were evaluated by comparing systems against manually generated annotations done by curators from the BioGRID and MINT databases. The highest AUC iP/R achieved by any run was 53%, the best MCC score 0.55. In case of competitive systems with an acceptable recall (above 35%) the macro-averaged precision ranged between 50% and 80%, with a maximum F-Score of 55%. CONCLUSIONS The results of the ACT task of BioCreative III indicate that classification of large unbalanced article collections reflecting the real class imbalance is still challenging. Nevertheless, text-mining tools that report ranked lists of relevant articles for manual selection can potentially reduce the time needed to identify half of the relevant articles to less than 1/4 of the time when compared to unranked results. Detecting associations between full text articles and interaction detection method PSI-MI terms (IMT) is more difficult than might be anticipated. This is due to the variability of method term mentions, errors resulting from pre-processing of articles provided as PDF files, and the heterogeneity and different granularity of method term concepts encountered in the ontology. However, combining the sophisticated techniques developed by the participants with supporting evidence strings derived from the articles for human interpretation could result in practical modules for biological annotation workflows.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hänzelmann, Sonja</author><author>Castelo, Robert</author><author>Guinney, Justin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GSVA: gene set variation analysis for microarray and RNA-seq data.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>7</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1471-2105</isbn><accession-num>23323831</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-14-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Hänzelmann, Castelo, Guinney - BMC bioinformatics - GSVA gene set variation analysis for microarray and RNA-seq data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/7</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23323831</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3618321</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. RESULTS To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. CONCLUSIONS GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gundem, Gunes</author><author>Lopez-Bigas, Nuria</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sample-level enrichment analysis unravels shared stress phenotypes among multiple cancer types.</title><secondary-title>Genome medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>28</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>1756-994X (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>22458606</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/gm327</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Gundem, Lopez-Bigas - Genome medicine - Sample-level enrichment analysis unravels shared stress phenotypes among multiple cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/gm327</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22458606</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3446278</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Adaptation to stress signals in the tumor microenvironment is a crucial step towards carcinogenic phenotype. The adaptive alterations attained by cells to withstand different types of insults are collectively referred to as the stress phenotypes of cancers. In this manuscript we explore the interrelation of different stress phenotypes in multiple cancer types and ask if these phenotypes could be used to explain prognostic differences among tumor samples. METHODS We propose a new approach based on enrichment analysis at the level of samples (sample-level enrichment analysis - SLEA) in expression profiling datasets. Without using a priori phenotypic information about samples, SLEA calculates an enrichment score per sample per gene set using z-test. This score is used to determine the relative importance of the corresponding pathway or module in different patient groups. RESULTS Our analysis shows that tumors significantly upregulating genes related to chromosome instability strongly correlate with worse prognosis in breast cancer. Moreover, in multiple tumor types, these tumors upregulate a senescence-bypass transcriptional program and exhibit similar stress phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS Using SLEA we are able to find relationships between stress phenotype pathways across multiple cancer types. Moreover we show that SLEA enables the identification of gene sets in correlation with clinical characteristics such as survival, as well as the identification of biological pathways/processes that underlie the pathology of different cancer subgroups.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gene Ontology Consortium</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Gene Ontology in 2010: extensions and refinements.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D331-5</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>Database issue</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1362-4962</isbn><accession-num>19920128</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkp1018</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Gene Ontology Consortium - Nucleic acids research - The Gene Ontology in 2010 extensions and refinements.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808930/pdf/gkp1018.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19920128</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2808930</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium (http://www.geneontology.org) (GOC) continues to develop, maintain and use a set of structured, controlled vocabularies for the annotation of genes, gene products and sequences.

The annual number of deaths equals the number of newly diagnosed cases, despite maximal treatment. The overall 5-year survival rate of &lt;5% has remained stubbornly unchanged over the last 30 years, despite tremendous efforts in preclinical and clinical science. There is unquestionably an urgent need to further improve our understanding of pancreatic cancer biology, treatment response and relapse, and to identify novel therapeutic targets. Rigorous research in the field has uncovered genetic aberrations that occur during PDAC development and progression. In most cases, PDAC is initiated by oncogenic mutant KRAS, which has been shown to drive pancreatic neoplasia. However, all attempts to target KRAS directly have failed in the clinic and KRAS is widely assumed to be undruggable. This has led to intense efforts to identify druggable critical downstream targets and nodes orchestrated by mutationally activated KRAS. This includes context-specific KRAS effector pathways, synthetic lethal interaction partners and KRAS-driven metabolic changes. Here, we review recent advances in oncogenic KRAS signalling and discuss how these might benefit PDAC treatment in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramaswamy, Sridhar</author><author>Ross, Ken N</author><author>Lander, Eric S</author><author>Golub, Todd R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A molecular signature of metastasis in primary solid tumors.</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>49-54</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><isbn>1061-4036</isbn><accession-num>12469122</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng1060</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2003 - Ramaswamy et al. - Nature genetics - A molecular signature of metastasis in primary solid tumors.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1060.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12469122</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Metastasis is the principal event leading to death in individuals with cancer, yet its molecular basis is poorly understood. To explore the molecular differences between human primary tumors and metastases, we compared the gene-expression profiles of adenocarcinoma metastases of multiple tumor types to unmatched primary adenocarcinomas. We found a gene-expression signature that distinguished primary from metastatic adenocarcinomas. More notably, we found that a subset of primary tumors resembled metastatic tumors with respect to this gene-expression signature. We confirmed this finding by applying the expression signature to data on 279 primary solid tumors of diverse types. We found that solid tumors carrying the gene-expression signature were most likely to be associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcome (P &lt; 0.03). These results suggest that the metastatic potential of human tumors is encoded in the bulk of a primary tumor, thus challenging the notion that metastases arise from rare cells within a primary tumor that have the ability to metastasize.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alexandrov, Ludmil B</author><author>Jones, Philip H</author><author>Wedge, David C</author><author>Sale, Julian E</author><author>Campbell, Peter J</author><author>Nik-Zainal, Serena</author><author>Stratton, Michael R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clock-like mutational processes in human somatic cells.</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1402-7</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1546-1718 (Electronic)\r1061-4036 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>26551669</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng.3441</electronic-resource-num><notes>We previously reported a mathematical approach and computational framework to extract mutational signatures from catalogs of somatic mutations in human cancers [4–6].

Different mutational processes may contribute to the mutations accumulated in a cell, with each imprinting a mutational signature on the cell's genome. Some processes generate mutations throughout life at a constant rate in all individuals, and the number of mutations in a cell attributable to these processes will be proportional to the chronological age of the person. Using mutations from 10,250 cancer genomes across 36 cancer types, we investigated clock-like mutational processes that have been operating in normal human cells. Two mutational signatures show clock-like properties. Both exhibit different mutation rates in different tissues. However, their mutation rates are not correlated, indicating that the underlying processes are subject to different biological influences. For one signature, the rate of cell division may influence its mutation rate. This study provides the first survey of clock-like mutational processes operating in human somatic cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chaves, Madalena</author><author>Albert, Réka</author><author>Sontag, Eduardo D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Robustness and fragility of Boolean models for genetic regulatory networks.</title><secondary-title>Journal of theoretical biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of theoretical biology</full-title></periodical><pages>431-49</pages><volume>235</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Boolean models</keyword><keyword>Gene regulatory networks</keyword><keyword>Segment polarity genes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><isbn>0022-5193 (Print)\n0022-5193 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>15882705</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.01.023</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2005 - Chaves, Albert, Sontag - Journal of theoretical biology - Robustness and fragility of Boolean models for genetic regulatory netwo.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519305000500/1-s2.0-S0022519305000500-main.pdf?_tid=d060ea08-3c17-4139-9f92-65418052bcac&amp;acdnat=1529444209_2dc0c63a7efd951d346d769a363a0ae5</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15882705</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Interactions between genes and gene products give rise to complex circuits that enable cells to process information and respond to external signals. Theoretical studies often describe these interactions using continuous, stochastic, or logical approaches. We propose a new modeling framework for gene regulatory networks, that combines the intuitive appeal of a qualitative description of gene states with a high flexibility in incorporating stochasticity in the duration of cellular processes. We apply our methods to the regulatory network of the segment polarity genes, thus gaining novel insights into the development of gene expression patterns. For example, we show that very short synthesis and decay times can perturb the wild-type pattern. On the other hand, separation of time-scales between pre- and post-translational processes and a minimal prepattern ensure convergence to the wild-type expression pattern regardless of fluctuations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Yue</author><author>Hoang, Tham H.</author><author>Joshi, Pujan</author><author>Hong, Seung Hyun</author><author>Giardina, Charles</author><author>Shin, Dong Guk</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A route-based pathway analysis framework integrating mutation information and gene expression data</title><secondary-title>Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Methods</full-title></periodical><pages>3-12</pages><volume>124</volume><keywords><keyword>Bayesian network</keyword><keyword>Data integration</keyword><keyword>Modeling and simulation</keyword><keyword>Pathway analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.06.016</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Zhao et al. - Methods - A route-based pathway analysis framework integrating mutation information and gene expression data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.06.016</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We propose a new way of analyzing biological pathways in which the analysis combines both transcriptome data and mutation information and uses the outcome to identify “routes” of aberrant pathways potentially responsible for the etiology of disease. Each pathway route is encoded as a Bayesian Network which is initialized with a sequence of conditional probabilities which are designed to encode directionality of regulatory relationships encoded in the pathways, i.e. activation and inhibition relationships. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through simulation in which the model was able to easily separate Test samples from Control samples using fictitiously perturbed pathway routes. Second, we apply our model to analyze the Breast Cancer data set, available from TCGA, against many cancer pathways available from KEGG and rank the significance of identified pathways. The outcome is consistent with what have already been reported in the literature. Third, survival analysis has been carried out on the same data set by using pathway routes as features. Overall, we envision that our model of using pathway routes for analysis can further refine the conventional ways of subtyping cancer patients as it can discover additional characteristics specific to individual's tumor.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cho, Ara</author><author>Shim, Jung Eun</author><author>Kim, Eiru</author><author>Supek, Fran</author><author>Lehner, Ben</author><author>Lee, Insuk</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MUFFINN: cancer gene discovery via network analysis of somatic mutation data.</title><secondary-title>Genome biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome biology</full-title></periodical><pages>129</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer gene prediction</keyword><keyword>Cancer genomes</keyword><keyword>Cancer somatic mutation</keyword><keyword>Functional gene network</keyword><keyword>Mutation frequency</keyword><keyword>Pathway-centric analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1474-760X (Electronic)\r1474-7596 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>27333808</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13059-016-0989-x</electronic-resource-num><notes>From the observed clustering of genes somatically mu- tated in cancers into pathways [18]

Precise identification and understanding of these altered pathways may provide novel insights into patient stratification, therapeutic strategies and the development of new drugs. However, a challenge remains in accurately identifying pathways altered by somatic mutations across human cancers, due to the diverse mutation spectrum. We developed an innovative approach to integrate somatic mutation data with gene networks and pathways, in order to identify pathways altered by somatic mutations across cancers. RESULTS We applied our approach to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of somatic mutations in 4790 cancer patients with 19 different types of tumors. Our analysis identified cancer-type-specific altered pathways enriched with known cancer-relevant genes and targets of currently available drugs. To investigate the clinical significance of these altered pathways, we performed consensus clustering for patient stratification using member genes in the altered pathways coupled with gene expression datasets from 4870 patients from TCGA, and multiple independent cohorts confirmed that the altered pathways could be used to stratify patients into subgroups with significantly different clinical outcomes. Of particular significance, certain patient subpopulations with poor prognosis were identified because they had specific altered pathways for which there are available targeted therapies. These findings could be used to tailor and intensify therapy in these patients, for whom current therapy is suboptimal.

Large-scale signaling networks are currently being reconstructed, but the kinetic parameters and quantitative data that would allow for dynamic modeling are still scarce. Therefore, computational studies based upon the structure of these networks are of great interest. Here, a methodology relying on a logical formalism is applied to the functional analysis of the complex signaling network governing the activation of T cells via the T cell receptor, the CD4/CD8 co-receptors, and the accessory signaling receptor CD28. Our large-scale Boolean model, which comprises 94 nodes and 123 interactions and is based upon well-established qualitative knowledge from primary T cells, reveals important structural features (e.g., feedback loops and network-wide dependencies) and recapitulates the global behavior of this network for an array of published data on T cell activation in wild-type and knock-out conditions. More importantly, the model predicted unexpected signaling events after antibody-mediated perturbation of CD28 and after genetic knockout of the kinase Fyn that were subsequently experimentally validated. Finally, we show that the logical model reveals key elements and potential failure modes in network functioning and provides candidates for missing links. In summary, our large-scale logical model for T cell activation proved to be a promising in silico tool, and it inspires immunologists to ask new questions. We think that it holds valuable potential in foreseeing the effects of drugs and network modifications.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gupta, Simone</author><author>Bisht, Siddharth S</author><author>Kukreti, Ritushree</author><author>Jain, Sanjeev</author><author>Brahmachari, Samir K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Boolean network analysis of a neurotransmitter signaling pathway.</title><secondary-title>Journal of theoretical biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of theoretical biology</full-title></periodical><pages>463-9</pages><volume>244</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Biochemical pathways</keyword><keyword>Boolean network</keyword><keyword>Dopaminergic signaling</keyword><keyword>Glutaminergic signaling</keyword><keyword>Schizophrenia</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17010384</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.08.014</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Gupta et al. - Journal of theoretical biology - Boolean network analysis of a neurotransmitter signaling pathway.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519306003675/1-s2.0-S0022519306003675-main.pdf?_tid=08d6b0c5-1e35-438c-8dba-47d09fe7b93b&amp;acdnat=1529416586_d793b7d3ef50c8bbb7db3f60dd4d72f6</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17010384</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND A Boolean network is a simple computational model that may provide insight into the overall behavior of genetic networks and is represented by variables with two possible states (on/off), of the individual nodes/genes of the network. In this study, a Boolean network model has been used to simulate a molecular pathway between two neurotransmitter receptor, dopamine and glutamate receptor, systems in order to understand the consequence of using logic gate rules between nodes, which have two possible states (active and inactive). RESULTS The dynamical properties of this Boolean network model of the biochemical pathway shows that, the pathway is stable and that, deletion/knockout of certain biologically important nodes cause significant perturbation to this network. The analysis clearly shows that in addition to the expected components dopamine and dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2), Ca(2+) ions play a critical role in maintaining stability of the pathway. CONCLUSION So this method may be useful for the identification of potential genetic targets, whose loss of function in biochemical pathways may be responsible for disease onset. The molecular pathway considered in this study has been implicated with a complex disorder like schizophrenia, which has a complex multifactorial etiology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Web Page">16</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hidde de Jong</author><author>Hidde de, Jong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling and Simulation of Genetic Regulatory Systems: A Literature Review</title></titles><periodical/><keywords><keyword>COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY</keyword><keyword>GENETIC REGULATORY NETWORKS</keyword><keyword>MATHEMATICAL MODELING</keyword><keyword>SIMULATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2004 - Hidde de Jong, Hidde de - Unknown - Modeling and Simulation of Genetic Regulatory Systems A Literature Review.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00072606/document</url><url>http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/10665270252833208?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=cmb</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kauffman, S A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metabolic stability and epigenesis in randomly constructed genetic nets.</title><secondary-title>Journal of theoretical biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of theoretical biology</full-title></periodical><pages>437-67</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1969</year></dates><isbn>0022-5193 (Print)</isbn><accession-num>5803332</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0022-5193(69)90015-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://1969 - Kauffman - Journal of theoretical biology - Metabolic stability and epigenesis in randomly constructed genetic nets.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/0022519369900150/1-s2.0-0022519369900150-main.pdf?_tid=4909282a-3186-4cb7-9d2a-beede0901823&amp;acdnat=1529416281_e034981369f282403e3be1771e600bca</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5803332</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Proto-organisms probably were randomly aggregated nets of chemical reactions. The hypothesis that contemporary organisms are also randomly constructed molecular automata is examined by modeling the gene as a binary (on-off) device and studying the behavior of large, randomly constructed nets of these binary &quot;genes&quot;. The results suggest that, if each &quot;gene&quot; is directly affected by two or three other &quot;genes&quot;, then such random nets: behave with great order and stability; undergo behavior cycles whose length predicts cell replication time as a function of the number of genes per cell; possess different modes of behavior whose number per net predicts roughly the number of cell types in an organism as a function of its number of genes; and under the stimulus of noise are capable of differentiating directly from any mode of behavior to at most a few other modes of behavior. Cellular differentation is modeled as a Markov chain among the modes of behavior of a genetic net. The possibility of a general theory of metabolic behavior is suggested. © 1969.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nelander, Sven</author><author>Wang, Weiqing</author><author>Nilsson, Björn</author><author>She, Qing-Bai</author><author>Pratilas, Christine</author><author>Rosen, Neal</author><author>Gennemark, Peter</author><author>Sander, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Models from experiments: combinatorial drug perturbations of cancer cells.</title><secondary-title>Molecular systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>216</pages><volume>4</volume><keywords><keyword>Combination therapy</keyword><keyword>Network dynamics</keyword><keyword>Network pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Synthetic biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><isbn>1744-4292 (Electronic)\r1744-4292 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>18766176</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/msb.2008.53</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2008 - Nelander et al. - Molecular systems biology - Models from experiments combinatorial drug perturbations of cancer cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://msb.embopress.org/content/msb/4/1/216.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18766176</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2564730</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We present a novel method for deriving network models from molecular profiles of perturbed cellular systems. The network models aim to predict quantitative outcomes of combinatorial perturbations, such as drug pair treatments or multiple genetic alterations. Mathematically, we represent the system by a set of nodes, representing molecular concentrations or cellular processes, a perturbation vector and an interaction matrix. After perturbation, the system evolves in time according to differential equations with built-in nonlinearity, similar to Hopfield networks, capable of representing epistasis and saturation effects. For a particular set of experiments, we derive the interaction matrix by minimizing a composite error function, aiming at accuracy of prediction and simplicity of network structure. To evaluate the predictive potential of the method, we performed 21 drug pair treatment experiments in a human breast cancer cell line (MCF7) with observation of phospho-proteins and cell cycle markers. The best derived network model rediscovered known interactions and contained interesting predictions. Possible applications include the discovery of regulatory interactions, the design of targeted combination therapies and the engineering of molecular biological networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sachs, Karen</author><author>Perez, Omar</author><author>Pe'er, Dana</author><author>Lauffenburger, Douglas A</author><author>Nolan, Garry P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Causal protein-signaling networks derived from multiparameter single-cell data.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>523-9</pages><volume>308</volume><issue>5721</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><isbn>0038-0938\r1573-093X</isbn><accession-num>15845847</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1105809</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2005 - Sachs et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Causal protein-signaling networks derived from multiparameter single-cell data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1584584</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15845847</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Machine learning was applied for the automated derivation of causal influences in cellular signaling networks.

Drugs that therapeutically modulate the biological processes of disease are developed using single protein target strategies, often with limited knowledge of the complex underlying role of the targets. Approaches that attempt to consider the combinatorial complexity from the outset might help identify any causal relationships that could lead to undesirable or adverse side effects earlier in the development pipeline. Such approaches, in particular logic methodologies, might also aid pathway selection and multiple target strategies during the drug discovery phase. Here, we describe the use of logic as a tractable and informative approach to modelling biological pathways that can allow us to improve our understanding of the dependencies in complex biological processes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morris, Melody K.</author><author>Saez-Rodriguez, Julio</author><author>Clarke, David C.</author><author>Sorger, Peter K.</author><author>Lauffenburger, Douglas A.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Beard, Daniel A.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Training signaling pathway maps to biochemical data with constrained fuzzy logic: quantitative analysis of liver cell responses to inflammatory stimuli.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1001099</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Public Library of Science</publisher><isbn>1553-7358 (Electronic)$\$r1553-734X (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21408212</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001099</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Morris et al. - PLoS computational biology - Training signaling pathway maps to biochemical data with constrained fuzzy logic qua.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001099</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21408212</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3048376</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response. Our methodology systematically and quantitatively trains a protein pathway map summarizing curated literature to context-specific biochemical data. This process generates a computable model yielding successful prediction of new test data and offering biological insight into complex datasets that are difficult to fully analyze by intuition alone.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saez-Rodriguez, Julio</author><author>Alexopoulos, Leonidas G</author><author>Epperlein, Jonathan</author><author>Samaga, Regina</author><author>Lauffenburger, Douglas A</author><author>Klamt, Steffen</author><author>Sorger, Peter K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Discrete logic modelling as a means to link protein signalling networks with functional analysis of mammalian signal transduction.</title><secondary-title>Molecular systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>331</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>Logical modelling</keyword><keyword>Protein networks</keyword><keyword>Signal transduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>1744-4292</isbn><accession-num>19953085</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/msb.2009.87</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Saez-Rodriguez et al. - Molecular systems biology - Discrete logic modelling as a means to link protein signalling networks with.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://msb.embopress.org/content/msb/5/1/331.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19953085</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2824489</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Large-scale protein signalling networks are useful for exploring complex biochemical pathways but do not reveal how pathways respond to specific stimuli. Such specificity is critical for understanding disease and designing drugs. Here we describe a computational approach--implemented in the free CNO software--for turning signalling networks into logical models and calibrating the models against experimental data. When a literature-derived network of 82 proteins covering the immediate-early responses of human cells to seven cytokines was modelled, we found that training against experimental data dramatically increased predictive power, despite the crudeness of Boolean approximations, while significantly reducing the number of interactions. Thus, many interactions in literature-derived networks do not appear to be functional in the liver cells from which we collected our data. At the same time, CNO identified several new interactions that improved the match of model to data. Although missing from the starting network, these interactions have literature support. Our approach, therefore, represents a means to generate predictive, cell-type-specific models of mammalian signalling from generic protein signalling networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Francavilla, Chiara</author><author>Lupia, Michela</author><author>Tsafou, Kalliopi</author><author>Villa, Alessandra</author><author>Kowalczyk, Katarzyna</author><author>Rakownikow Jersie-Christensen, Rosa</author><author>Bertalot, Giovanni</author><author>Confalonieri, Stefano</author><author>Brunak, Søren</author><author>Jensen, Lars J</author><author>Cavallaro, Ugo</author><author>Olsen, Jesper V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphoproteomics of Primary Cells Reveals Druggable Kinase Signatures in Ovarian Cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cell reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell reports</full-title></periodical><pages>3242-3256</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>CDK7</keyword><keyword>EOC</keyword><keyword>OSE</keyword><keyword>POLR2A</keyword><keyword>THZ1</keyword><keyword>alternative splicing</keyword><keyword>fimbriae</keyword><keyword>ovarian cancer</keyword><keyword>phosphoproteomics</keyword><keyword>quantitative proteomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28355574</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.015</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Francavilla et al. - Cell reports - Phosphoproteomics of Primary Cells Reveals Druggable Kinase Signatures in Ovarian Cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(17)30332-7.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28355574</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5382236</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Our understanding of the molecular determinants of cancer is still inadequate because of cancer heterogeneity. Here, using epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) as a model system, we analyzed a minute amount of patient-derived epithelial cells from either healthy or cancerous tissues by single-shot mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we demonstrated that primary cells recapitulate tissue complexity and represent a valuable source of differentially expressed proteins and phosphorylation sites that discriminate cancer from healthy cells. Furthermore, we uncovered kinase signatures associated with EOC. In particular, CDK7 targets were characterized in both EOC primary cells and ovarian cancer cell lines. We showed that CDK7 controls cell proliferation and that pharmacological inhibition of CDK7 selectively represses EOC cell proliferation. Our approach defines the molecular landscape of EOC, paving the way for efficient therapeutic approaches for patients. Finally, we highlight the potential of phosphoproteomics to identify clinically relevant and druggable pathways in cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dazert, Eva</author><author>Colombi, Marco</author><author>Boldanova, Tujana</author><author>Moes, Suzette</author><author>Adametz, David</author><author>Quagliata, Luca</author><author>Roth, Volker</author><author>Terracciano, Luigi</author><author>Heim, Markus H</author><author>Jenoe, Paul</author><author>Hall, Michael N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics on serial tumor biopsies from a sorafenib-treated HCC patient.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>1381-6</pages><volume>113</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>EMT</keyword><keyword>MAPK</keyword><keyword>evasive resistance</keyword><keyword>liver</keyword><keyword>signal transduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1091-6490 (Electronic)\r0027-8424 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>26787912</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1523434113</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Dazert et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Quantitative proteomics and pho.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/5/1381.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1523434113</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26787912</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4747770</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Compensatory signaling pathways in tumors confer resistance to targeted therapy, but the pathways and their mechanisms of activation remain largely unknown. We describe a procedure for quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics on snap-frozen biopsies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and matched nontumor liver tissue. We applied this procedure to monitor signaling pathways in serial biopsies taken from an HCC patient before and during treatment with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. At diagnosis, the patient had an advanced HCC. At the time of the second biopsy, abdominal imaging revealed progressive disease despite sorafenib treatment. Sorafenib was confirmed to inhibit MAPK signaling in the tumor, as measured by reduced ribosomal protein S6 kinase phosphorylation. Hierarchical clustering and enrichment analysis revealed pathways broadly implicated in tumor progression and resistance, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell adhesion pathways. Thus, we describe a protocol for quantitative analysis of oncogenic pathways in HCC biopsies and obtained first insights into the effect of sorafenib in vivo. This protocol will allow elucidation of mechanisms of resistance and enable precision medicine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hogrebe, Alexander</author><author>von Stechow, Louise</author><author>Bekker-Jensen, Dorte B</author><author>Weinert, Brian T</author><author>Kelstrup, Christian D</author><author>Olsen, Jesper V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Benchmarking common quantification strategies for large-scale phosphoproteomics.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1045</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29535314</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-018-03309-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Hogrebe et al. - Nature communications - Benchmarking common quantification strategies for large-scale phosphoproteomics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03309-6.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29535314</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5849679</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Comprehensive mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is now feasible, but reproducible quantification remains challenging, especially for post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Here, we compare the most popular quantification techniques for global phosphoproteomics: label-free quantification (LFQ), stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and MS2- and MS3-measured tandem mass tags (TMT). In a mixed species comparison with fixed phosphopeptide ratios, we find LFQ and SILAC to be the most accurate techniques. MS2-based TMT yields the highest precision but lowest accuracy due to ratio compression, which MS3-based TMT can partly rescue. However, MS2-based TMT outperforms MS3-based TMT when analyzing phosphoproteome changes in the DNA damage response, since its higher precision and larger identification numbers allow detection of a greater number of significantly regulated phosphopeptides. Finally, we utilize the TMT multiplexing capabilities to develop an algorithm for determining phosphorylation site stoichiometry, showing that such applications benefit from the high accuracy of MS3-based TMT.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoffman, Nolan J</author><author>Parker, Benjamin L</author><author>Chaudhuri, Rima</author><author>Fisher-Wellman, Kelsey H.</author><author>Kleinert, Maximilian</author><author>Humphrey, Sean J.</author><author>Yang, Pengyi</author><author>Holliday, Mira</author><author>Trefely, Sophie</author><author>Fazakerley, Daniel J.</author><author>Stöckli, Jacqueline</author><author>Burchfield, James G.</author><author>Jensen, Thomas E.</author><author>Jothi, Raja</author><author>Kiens, Bente</author><author>Wojtaszewski, Jørgen F P</author><author>Richter, Erik A</author><author>James, David E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Human Skeletal Muscle Reveals a Network of Exercise-Regulated Kinases and AMPK Substrates.</title><secondary-title>Cell metabolism</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell metabolism</full-title></periodical><pages>922-35</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1932-7420 (Electronic)\r1550-4131 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>26437602</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cmet.2015.09.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Hoffman et al. - Cell metabolism - Global Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Human Skeletal Muscle Reveals a Network of Exercise-Regula.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1550413115004581/1-s2.0-S1550413115004581-main.pdf?_tid=1a2e01d2-f61e-44c5-8f0e-6f71191a9ec9&amp;acdnat=1529323583_f1b02f8c9ac07fc05d431a53123f6f1a</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26437602</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articleren</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Exercise is essential in regulating energy metabolism and whole-body insulin sensitivity. To explore the exercise signaling network, we undertook a global analysis of protein phosphorylation in human skeletal muscle biopsies from untrained healthy males before and after a single high-intensity exercise bout, revealing 1,004 unique exercise-regulated phosphosites on 562 proteins. These included substrates of known exercise-regulated kinases (AMPK, PKA, CaMK, MAPK, mTOR), yet the majority of kinases and substrate phosphosites have not previously been implicated in exercise signaling. Given the importance of AMPK in exercise-regulated metabolism, we performed a targeted in vitro AMPK screen and employed machine learning to predict exercise-regulated AMPK substrates. We validated eight predicted AMPK substrates, including AKAP1, using targeted phosphoproteomics. Functional characterization revealed an undescribed role for AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of AKAP1 in mitochondrial respiration. These data expose the unexplored complexity of acute exercise signaling and provide insights into the role of AMPK in mitochondrial biochemistry.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Terfve, Camille D A</author><author>Wilkes, Edmund H</author><author>Casado, Pedro</author><author>Cutillas, Pedro R</author><author>Saez-Rodriguez, Julio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Large-scale models of signal propagation in human cells derived from discovery phosphoproteomic data.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>8033</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>doi:10.1038/ncomms9033</isbn><accession-num>26354681</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms9033</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Terfve et al. - Nature communications - Large-scale models of signal propagation in human cells derived from discovery phosphopro.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9033.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26354681</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4579397</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mass spectrometry is widely used to probe the proteome and its modifications in an untargeted manner, with unrivalled coverage. Applied to phosphoproteomics, it has tremendous potential to interrogate phospho-signalling and its therapeutic implications. However, this task is complicated by issues of undersampling of the phosphoproteome and challenges stemming from its high-content but low-sample-throughput nature. Hence, methods using such data to reconstruct signalling networks have been limited to restricted data sets and insights (for example, groups of kinases likely to be active in a sample). We propose a new method to handle high-content discovery phosphoproteomics data on perturbation by putting it in the context of kinase/phosphatase-substrate knowledge, from which we derive and train logic models. We show, on a data set obtained through perturbations of cancer cells with small-molecule inhibitors, that this method can study the targets and effects of kinase inhibitors, and reconcile insights obtained from multiple data sets, a common issue with these data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>López, Elena</author><author>Wesselink, Jan-Jaap</author><author>López, Isabel</author><author>Mendieta, Jesús</author><author>Gómez-Puertas, Paulino</author><author>Muñoz, Sarbelio Rodríguez</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Technical phosphoproteomic and bioinformatic tools useful in cancer research.</title><secondary-title>Journal of clinical bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of clinical bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>26</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>20439113</isbn><accession-num>21967744</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/2043-9113-1-26</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - López et al. - Journal of clinical bioinformatics - Technical phosphoproteomic and bioinformatic tools useful in cancer research.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195713/pdf/2043-9113-1-26.pdf</url><url>http://jclinbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2043-9113-1-26</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21967744</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Reversible protein phosphorylation is one of the most important forms of cellular regulation. Thus, phosphoproteomic analysis of protein phosphorylation in cells is a powerful tool to evaluate cell functional status. The importance of protein kinase-regulated signal transduction pathways in human cancer has led to the development of drugs that inhibit protein kinases at the apex or intermediary levels of these pathways. Phosphoproteomic analysis of these signalling pathways will provide important insights for operation and connectivity of these pathways to facilitate identification of the best targets for cancer therapies. Enrichment of phosphorylated proteins or peptides from tissue or bodily fluid samples is required. The application of technologies such as phosphoenrichments, mass spectrometry (MS) coupled to bioinformatics tools is crucial for the identification and quantification of protein phosphorylation sites for advancing in such relevant clinical research. A combination of different phosphopeptide enrichments, quantitative techniques and bioinformatic tools is necessary to achieve good phospho-regulation data and good structural analysis of protein studies. The current and most useful proteomics and bioinformatics techniques will be explained with research examples. Our aim in this article is to be helpful for cancer research via detailing proteomics and bioinformatic tools.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Riley, Nicholas M</author><author>Coon, Joshua J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphoproteomics in the Age of Rapid and Deep Proteome Profiling.</title><secondary-title>Analytical chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Analytical chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>74-94</pages><volume>88</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1520-6882 (Electronic)\r0003-2700 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>26539879</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04123</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Riley, Coon - Analytical chemistry - Phosphoproteomics in the Age of Rapid and Deep Proteome Profiling.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4790442/pdf/ac5b04123.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26539879</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4790442</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) that orchestrates a diverse array of cellular processes. Because this modification serves as a rapid and reversible means to modulate protein activity and transduce signals, the regulation of phosphorylation is a central mechanism in cell health and disease. The addition and removal of phosphoryl modifications via kinases and phosphates, respectively, makes the landscape of phosphorylation particularly dynamic. Understanding the complex networks and functions coordinated by phosphorylation requires knowledge of specific amino acid modifications with both spatial and temporal resolution - a task that remains a challenging analytical endeavor. Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as the premier tool for global PTM analysis, boasting high sensitivity, considerable throughput, and the capacity to localize modifications to a single residue. Indeed, MS-centric phosphoproteomics has become a standard approach for investigating protein phosphorylation in laboratories worldwide. Analytical Chemistry last reviewed the contribution of MS and related technologies to phosphoproteomics in 2011. Since that time, MS methodology has developed at an impressive pace. While routine proteomic experiments can now analyze thousands of proteins in just a few hours, rather than days or weeks, characterizing the global phosphoproteome is significantly more challenging than measuring non-modified proteins. The relative low abundance of phosphorylated peptides and the need for residue-specific information require special considerations in sample handling, data acquisition, and post-acquisition processing that constrain reproducibility, quantitative efficacy, throughput, and depth in phosphoproteomic workflows. Advances in MS-based approaches have remarkably improved our abilities to investigate the many roles of protein phosphorylation across a diverse set of biological contexts, but many technical obstacles still exist. Poor run-to-run overlap, challenges in confident phosphosite assignment, and complications inherent to various quantitative strategies limit biological insight, despite ever-increasing numbers of detected phosphopeptides. Focusing on work from the past two years (2013-2015), this review examines major developments in MS technology that have enabled the characterization of tens of thousands of phosphopeptides in a given experiment, and considers the contribution of this analytical power to translational research. We also discuss how future innovation can address technical challenges of today's methods, and we offer our perspective on how phosphoproteomics will continue to mature.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhu, Bo</author><author>He, Quanze</author><author>Xiang, Jingjing</author><author>Qi, Fang</author><author>Cai, Hao</author><author>Mao, Jun</author><author>Zhang, Chunhua</author><author>Zhang, Qin</author><author>Li, Haibo</author><author>Lu, Lu</author><author>Wang, Ting</author><author>Yu, Wenbo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis Reveals Key Mechanisms of Cellular Proliferation in Liver Cancer Cells.</title><secondary-title>Scientific reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific reports</full-title></periodical><pages>10908</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28883432</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-017-10716-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Zhu et al. - Scientific reports - Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis Reveals Key Mechanisms of Cellular Proliferation in Live.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195713/pdf/2043-9113-1-26.pdf</url><url>http://jclinbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2043-9113-1-26</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21967744</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Understanding the mechanisms of uncontrolled proliferation in cancer cells provides valuable insights into tumor development and is benefit for discovering efficient methods in cancer treatment. In this study, we identified and quantified 2,057 phosphoproteins and 9,824 unique phosphosites in three liver cell lines with high (QGY, Hep3B) and low (L02) proliferative potentials and disclosed the wide variations in phosphorylation sites and levels among them. We found that the number of identified phosphoproteins and phosphosites in these cells were negatively correlated with their proliferative abilities. The function analysis suggested that the aberrant phosphorylation of SR proteins and activation of MAPK pathway might be two critical factors to promote cancer cell proliferation. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation status of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) and nuclear pore (NPC) complexes are significantly different between cell lines with high and low proliferative potentials. Furthermore, the phosphosites targeted by kinase families of CDK, STE and HIPK in the proteins coded by cancer driver genes showed distinct profiles between caner and normal cell lines. These results present key phosphorylation networks involving in abnormal proliferation of cancer cells and uncovered potential molecular markers for estimating the proliferation ability of liver cancer cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luo, J</author><author>Schumacher, M</author><author>Scherer, A</author><author>Sanoudou, D</author><author>Megherbi, D</author><author>Davison, T</author><author>Shi, T</author><author>Tong, W</author><author>Shi, L</author><author>Hong, H</author><author>Zhao, C</author><author>Elloumi, F</author><author>Shi, W</author><author>Thomas, R</author><author>Lin, S</author><author>Tillinghast, G</author><author>Liu, G</author><author>Zhou, Y</author><author>Herman, D</author><author>Li, Y</author><author>Deng, Y</author><author>Fang, H</author><author>Bushel, P</author><author>Woods, M</author><author>Zhang, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparison of batch effect removal methods for enhancement of prediction performance using MAQC-II microarray gene expression data.</title><secondary-title>The pharmacogenomics journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The pharmacogenomics journal</full-title></periodical><pages>278-91</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>MAQC-II</keyword><keyword>batch effect</keyword><keyword>batch effect removal</keyword><keyword>cross-batch prediction</keyword><keyword>gene expression</keyword><keyword>microarray</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1473-1150 (Electronic)\r1470-269X (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>20676067</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/tpj.2010.57</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Luo et al. - The pharmacogenomics journal - A comparison of batch effect removal methods for enhancement of prediction performanc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2920074/pdf/tpj201057a.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20676067</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2920074</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Batch effects are the systematic non-biological differences between batches (groups) of samples in microarray experiments due to various causes such as differences in sample preparation and hybridization protocols. Previous work focused mainly on the development of methods for effective batch effects removal. However, their impact on cross-batch prediction performance, which is one of the most important goals in microarray-based applications, has not been addressed. This paper uses a broad selection of data sets from the Microarray Quality Control Phase II (MAQC-II) effort, generated on three microarray platforms with different causes of batch effects to assess the efficacy of their removal. Two data sets from cross-tissue and cross-platform experiments are also included. Of the 120 cases studied using Support vector machines (SVM) and K nearest neighbors (KNN) as classifiers and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as performance metric, we find that Ratio-G, Ratio-A, EJLR, mean-centering and standardization methods perform better or equivalent to no batch effect removal in 89, 85, 83, 79 and 75% of the cases, respectively, suggesting that the application of these methods is generally advisable and ratio-based methods are preferred.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Chao</author><author>Grennan, Kay</author><author>Badner, Judith</author><author>Zhang, Dandan</author><author>Gershon, Elliot</author><author>Jin, Li</author><author>Liu, Chunyu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Removing batch effects in analysis of expression microarray data: an evaluation of six batch adjustment methods.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e17238</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1932-6203 (Electronic)\r1932-6203 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21386892</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0017238</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Chen et al. - PloS one - Removing batch effects in analysis of expression microarray data an evaluation of six batch adjustment m.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017238&amp;type=printable</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21386892</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3046121</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The expression microarray is a frequently used approach to study gene expression on a genome-wide scale. However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by &quot;batch effects,&quot; the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. ComBat, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, W Evan</author><author>Li, Cheng</author><author>Rabinovic, Ariel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adjusting batch effects in microarray expression data using empirical Bayes methods.</title><secondary-title>Biostatistics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biostatistics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>118-27</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Batch effects</keyword><keyword>Empirical Bayes</keyword><keyword>Microarrays</keyword><keyword>Monte Carlo</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>1465-4644, 1468-4357</isbn><accession-num>16632515</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/biostatistics/kxj037</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Johnson, Li, Rabinovic - Biostatistics (Oxford, England) - Adjusting batch effects in microarray expression data using empirical.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16632515</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Non-biological experimental variation or &quot;batch effects&quot; are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( &gt; 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

Here we address whether this non-coding transcription arises at promoters, and detail the interactions of initiation factors TATA box binding protein (TBP), transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and RNA polymerase (Pol) II. Using ChIP-exo (chromatin immunoprecipitation with lambda exonuclease digestion followed by high-throughput sequencing), we identify approximately 160,000 transcription initiation complexes across the human K562 genome, and more in other cancer genomes. Only about 5% associate with messenger RNA genes. The remainder associates with non-polyadenylated non-coding transcription. Regardless, Pol II moves into a transcriptionally paused state, and TBP and TFIIB remain at the promoter. Remarkably, the vast majority of locations contain the four core promoter elements- upstream TFIIB recognition element (BREu), TATA, downstream TFIIB recognition element (BREd), and initiator element (INR)-in constrained positions. All but the INR also reside at Pol III promoters, where TBP makes similar contacts. This comprehensive and high-resolution genome-wide detection of the initiation machinery produces a consolidated view of transcription initiation events from yeast to humans at Pol II/III TATA-containing/TATA-less coding and non-coding genes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mehta, Raaj S.</author><author>Nishihara, Reiko</author><author>Cao, Yin</author><author>Song, Mingyang</author><author>Mima, Kosuke</author><author>Qian, Zhi Rong</author><author>Nowak, Jonathan A.</author><author>Kosumi, Keisuke</author><author>Hamada, Tsuyoshi</author><author>Masugi, Yohei</author><author>Bullman, Susan</author><author>Drew, David A.</author><author>Kostic, Aleksandar D.</author><author>Fung, Teresa T.</author><author>Garrett, Wendy S.</author><author>Huttenhower, Curtis</author><author>Wu, Kana</author><author>Meyerhardt, Jeffrey A.</author><author>Zhang, Xuehong</author><author>Willett, Walter C.</author><author>Giovannucci, Edward L.</author><author>Fuchs, Charles S.</author><author>Chan, Andrew T.</author><author>Ogino, Shuji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association of Dietary Patterns With Risk of Colorectal Cancer Subtypes Classified by Fusobacterium nucleatum in Tumor Tissue.</title><secondary-title>JAMA oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>921-927</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>2374-2445 (Electronic) 2374-2437 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>28125762</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.6374</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Mehta et al. - JAMA oncology - Association of Dietary Patterns With Risk of Colorectal Cancer Subtypes Classified by Fusobacteriu.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28125762</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5502000</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Importance Fusobacterium nucleatum appears to play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis through suppression of the hosts' immune response to tumor. Evidence also suggests that diet influences intestinal F nucleatum. However, the role of F nucleatum in mediating the relationship between diet and the risk of colorectal cancer is unknown. Objective To test the hypothesis that the associations of prudent diets (rich in whole grains and dietary fiber) and Western diets (rich in red and processed meat, refined grains, and desserts) with colorectal cancer risk may differ according to the presence of F nucleatum in tumor tissue. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Nurses' Health Study (June 1, 1980, to June 1, 2012) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (June 1, 1986, to June 1, 2012) on a total of 121 700 US female nurses and 51 529 US male health professionals aged 30 to 55 years and 40 to 75 years, respectively (both predominantly white individuals), at enrollment. Data analysis was performed from March 15, 2015, to August 10, 2016. Exposures Prudent and Western diets. Main Outcomes and Measures Incidence of colorectal carcinoma subclassified by F nucleatum status in tumor tissue, determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results Of the 173 229 individuals considered for the study, 137 217 were included in the analysis, 47 449 were male (34.6%), and mean (SD) baseline age for men was 54.0 (9.8) years and for women, 46.3 (7.2) years. A total of 1019 incident colon and rectal cancer cases with available F nucleatum data were documented over 26 to 32 years of follow-up, encompassing 3 643 562 person-years. The association of prudent diet with colorectal cancer significantly differed by tissue F nucleatum status (P = .01 for heterogeneity); prudent diet score was associated with a lower risk of F nucleatum-positive cancers (P = .003 for trend; multivariable hazard ratio of 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25-0.72, for the highest vs the lowest prudent score quartile) but not with F nucleatum-negative cancers (P = .47 for trend, the corresponding multivariable hazard ratio of 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77-1.17). There was no significant heterogeneity between the subgroups in relation to Western dietary pattern scores. Conclusions and Relevance Prudent diets rich in whole grains and dietary fiber are associated with a lower risk for F nucleatum-positive colorectal cancer but not F nucleatum-negative cancer, supporting a potential role for intestinal microbiota in mediating the association between diet and colorectal neoplasms.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zwang, Yaara</author><author>Jonas, Oliver</author><author>Chen, Casandra</author><author>Rinne, Mikael L.</author><author>Doench, John G.</author><author>Piccioni, Federica</author><author>Tan, Li</author><author>Huang, Hai-Tsang</author><author>Wang, Jinhua</author><author>Ham, Young Jin</author><author>O'Connell, Joyce</author><author>Bhola, Patrick</author><author>Doshi, Mihir</author><author>Whitman, Matthew</author><author>Cima, Michael</author><author>Letai, Anthony</author><author>Root, David E.</author><author>Langer, Robert S.</author><author>Gray, Nathanael</author><author>Hahn, William C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Synergistic interactions with PI3K inhibition that induce apoptosis.</title><secondary-title>eLife</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>eLife</full-title></periodical><pages>1-18</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>PI3K inhibition</keyword><keyword>cancer biology</keyword><keyword>genome-scale shRNA screen</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>response modifying genes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28561737</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.7554/eLife.24523</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Zwang et al. - eLife - Synergistic interactions with PI3K inhibition that induce apoptosis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28561737</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5479695</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Activating mutations involving the PI3K pathway occur frequently in human cancers. However, PI3K inhibitors primarily induce cell cycle arrest, leaving a significant reservoir of tumor cells that may acquire or exhibit resistance. We searched for genes that are required for the survival of PI3K mutant cancer cells in the presence of PI3K inhibition by conducting a genome scale shRNA-based apoptosis screen in a PIK3CA mutant human breast cancer cell. We identified 5 genes (PIM2, ZAK, TACC1, ZFR, ZNF565) whose suppression induced cell death upon PI3K inhibition. We showed that small molecule inhibitors of the PIM2 and ZAK kinases synergize with PI3K inhibition. In addition, using a microscale implementable device to deliver either siRNAs or small molecule inhibitors in vivo, we showed that suppressing these 5 genes with PI3K inhibition induced tumor regression. These observations identify targets whose inhibition synergizes with PI3K inhibitors and nominate potential combination therapies involving PI3K inhibition.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Geller, Leore T</author><author>Barzily-Rokni, Michal</author><author>Danino, Tal</author><author>Jonas, Oliver H</author><author>Shental, Noam</author><author>Nejman, Deborah</author><author>Gavert, Nancy</author><author>Zwang, Yaara</author><author>Cooper, Zachary A</author><author>Shee, Kevin</author><author>Thaiss, Christoph A</author><author>Reuben, Alexandre</author><author>Livny, Jonathan</author><author>Avraham, Roi</author><author>Frederick, Dennie T</author><author>Ligorio, Matteo</author><author>Chatman, Kelly</author><author>Johnston, Stephen E</author><author>Mosher, Carrie M</author><author>Brandis, Alexander</author><author>Fuks, Garold</author><author>Gurbatri, Candice</author><author>Gopalakrishnan, Vancheswaran</author><author>Kim, Michael</author><author>Hurd, Mark W</author><author>Katz, Matthew</author><author>Fleming, Jason</author><author>Maitra, Anirban</author><author>Smith, David A</author><author>Skalak, Matt</author><author>Bu, Jeffrey</author><author>Michaud, Monia</author><author>Trauger, Sunia A</author><author>Barshack, Iris</author><author>Golan, Talia</author><author>Sandbank, Judith</author><author>Flaherty, Keith T</author><author>Mandinova, Anna</author><author>Garrett, Wendy S</author><author>Thayer, Sarah P</author><author>Ferrone, Cristina R</author><author>Huttenhower, Curtis</author><author>Bhatia, Sangeeta N</author><author>Gevers, Dirk</author><author>Wargo, Jennifer A</author><author>Golub, Todd R</author><author>Straussman, Ravid</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential role of intratumor bacteria in mediating tumor resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>1156-1160</pages><volume>357</volume><issue>6356</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28912244</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.aah5043</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Geller et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Potential role of intratumor bacteria in mediating tumor resistance to the chemotherap.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/357/6356/1156.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28912244</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5727343</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Growing evidence suggests that microbes can influence the efficacy of cancer therapies. By studying colon cancer models, we found that bacteria can metabolize the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine) into its inactive form, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine. Metabolism was dependent on the expression of a long isoform of the bacterial enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDDL), seen primarily in Gammaproteobacteria. In a colon cancer mouse model, gemcitabine resistance was induced by intratumor Gammaproteobacteria, dependent on bacterial CDDL expression, and abrogated by cotreatment with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. Gemcitabine is commonly used to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and we hypothesized that intratumor bacteria might contribute to drug resistance of these tumors. Consistent with this possibility, we found that of the 113 human PDACs that were tested, 86 (76%) were positive for bacteria, mainly Gammaproteobacteria.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mima, Kosuke</author><author>Cao, Yin</author><author>Chan, Andrew T</author><author>Qian, Zhi Rong</author><author>Nowak, Jonathan A</author><author>Masugi, Yohei</author><author>Shi, Yan</author><author>Song, Mingyang</author><author>da Silva, Annacarolina</author><author>Gu, Mancang</author><author>Li, Wanwan</author><author>Hamada, Tsuyoshi</author><author>Kosumi, Keisuke</author><author>Hanyuda, Akiko</author><author>Liu, Li</author><author>Kostic, Aleksandar D</author><author>Giannakis, Marios</author><author>Bullman, Susan</author><author>Brennan, Caitlin A</author><author>Milner, Danny A</author><author>Baba, Hideo</author><author>Garraway, Levi A</author><author>Meyerhardt, Jeffrey A</author><author>Garrett, Wendy S</author><author>Huttenhower, Curtis</author><author>Meyerson, Matthew</author><author>Giovannucci, Edward L</author><author>Fuchs, Charles S.</author><author>Nishihara, Reiko</author><author>Ogino, Shuji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fusobacterium nucleatum in Colorectal Carcinoma Tissue According to Tumor Location.</title><secondary-title>Clinical and translational gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical and translational gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>e200</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27811909</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ctg.2016.53</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Mima et al. - Clinical and translational gastroenterology - Fusobacterium nucleatum in Colorectal Carcinoma Tissue According to T.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ctg201653.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27811909</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5543402</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>OBJECTIVES Evidence suggests a possible role of Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal carcinogenesis, especially in right-sided proximal colorectum. Considering a change in bowel contents and microbiome from proximal to distal colorectal segments, we hypothesized that the proportion of colorectal carcinoma enriched with F. nucleatum might gradually increase along the bowel subsites from rectum to cecum. METHODS A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 1,102 colon and rectal carcinomas in molecular pathological epidemiology databases of the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We measured the amount of F. nucleatum DNA in colorectal tumor tissue using a quantitative PCR assay and equally dichotomized F. nucleatum-positive cases (high vs. low). We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the relationship of a bowel subsite variable (rectum, rectosigmoid junction, sigmoid colon, descending colon, splenic flexure, transverse colon, hepatic flexure, ascending colon, and cecum) with the amount of F. nucleatum. RESULTS The proportion of F. nucleatum-high colorectal cancers gradually increased from rectal cancers (2.5%; 4/157) to cecal cancers (11%; 19/178), with a statistically significant linear trend along all subsites (P&lt;0.0001) and little evidence of non-linearity. The proportion of F. nucleatum-low cancers was higher in rectal, ascending colon, and cecal cancers than in cancers of middle segments. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of F. nucleatum-high colorectal cancers gradually increases from rectum to cecum. Our data support the colorectal continuum model that reflects pathogenic influences of the gut microbiota on neoplastic and immune cells and challenges the prevailing two-colon (proximal vs. distal) dichotomy paradigm.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luber, Jacob M</author><author>Tierney, Braden T</author><author>Cofer, Evan M</author><author>Patel, Chirag J</author><author>Kostic, Aleksandar D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aether: leveraging linear programming for optimal cloud computing in genomics.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>1565-1567</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29228186</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btx787</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Luber et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Aether leveraging linear programming for optimal cloud computing in genomics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://github.com/kosti</url><url>http://aether.kosticlab.org.</url><url>http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/13/162883.abstract</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29228186</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5925767</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation Across biology, we are seeing rapid developments in scale of data production without a corresponding increase in data analysis capabilities.

To uncover its mutational spectrum, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 74 tumor-normal pairs. The majority exhibited a mutational profile consistent with tobacco exposure; human papillomavirus was detectable by sequencing DNA from infected tumors. In addition to identifying previously known HNSCC genes (TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and HRAS), our analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated in this malignancy. At least 30% of cases harbored mutations in genes that regulate squamous differentiation (for example, NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating its dysregulation as a major driver of HNSCC carcinogenesis. More generally, the results indicate the ability of large-scale sequencing to reveal fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheung, Hiu Wing</author><author>Cowley, Glenn S</author><author>Weir, Barbara A</author><author>Boehm, Jesse S</author><author>Rusin, Scott</author><author>Scott, Justine A</author><author>East, Alexandra</author><author>Ali, Levi D</author><author>Lizotte, Patrick H</author><author>Wong, Terence C</author><author>Jiang, Guozhi</author><author>Hsiao, Jessica</author><author>Mermel, Craig H</author><author>Getz, Gad</author><author>Barretina, Jordi</author><author>Gopal, Shuba</author><author>Tamayo, Pablo</author><author>Gould, Joshua</author><author>Tsherniak, Aviad</author><author>Stransky, Nicolas</author><author>Luo, Biao</author><author>Ren, Yin</author><author>Drapkin, Ronny</author><author>Bhatia, Sangeeta N</author><author>Mesirov, Jill P</author><author>Garraway, Levi A</author><author>Meyerson, Matthew</author><author>Lander, Eric S</author><author>Root, David E</author><author>Hahn, William C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systematic investigation of genetic vulnerabilities across cancer cell lines reveals lineage-specific dependencies in ovarian cancer.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>12372-7</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>30</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>13624962 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>21746896</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1109363108</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Cheung et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Systematic investigation of gen.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/30/12372.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21746896</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3145679</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A comprehensive understanding of the molecular vulnerabilities of every type of cancer will provide a powerful roadmap to guide therapeutic approaches. Efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas Project will identify genes with aberrant copy number, sequence, or expression in various cancer types, providing a survey of the genes that may have a causal role in cancer. A complementary approach is to perform systematic loss-of-function studies to identify essential genes in particular cancer cell types. We have begun a systematic effort, termed Project Achilles, aimed at identifying genetic vulnerabilities across large numbers of cancer cell lines. Here, we report the assessment of the essentiality of 11,194 genes in 102 human cancer cell lines. We show that the integration of these functional data with information derived from surveying cancer genomes pinpoints known and previously undescribed lineage-specific dependencies across a wide spectrum of cancers. In particular, we found 54 genes that are specifically essential for the proliferation and viability of ovarian cancer cells and also amplified in primary tumors or differentially overexpressed in ovarian cancer cell lines. One such gene, PAX8, is focally amplified in 16% of high-grade serous ovarian cancers and expressed at higher levels in ovarian tumors. Suppression of PAX8 selectively induces apoptotic cell death of ovarian cancer cells. These results identify PAX8 as an ovarian lineage-specific dependency. More generally, these observations demonstrate that the integration of genome-scale functional and structural studies provides an efficient path to identify dependencies of specific cancer types on particular genes and pathways.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hong, Andrew L</author><author>Tseng, Yuen-Yi</author><author>Cowley, Glenn S</author><author>Jonas, Oliver</author><author>Cheah, Jaime H</author><author>Kynnap, Bryan D</author><author>Doshi, Mihir B</author><author>Oh, Coyin</author><author>Meyer, Stephanie C</author><author>Church, Alanna J</author><author>Gill, Shubhroz</author><author>Bielski, Craig M</author><author>Keskula, Paula</author><author>Imamovic, Alma</author><author>Howell, Sara</author><author>Kryukov, Gregory V</author><author>Clemons, Paul A</author><author>Tsherniak, Aviad</author><author>Vazquez, Francisca</author><author>Crompton, Brian D</author><author>Shamji, Alykhan F</author><author>Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos</author><author>Janeway, Katherine A</author><author>Roberts, Charles W M</author><author>Stegmaier, Kimberly</author><author>van Hummelen, Paul</author><author>Cima, Michael J</author><author>Langer, Robert S</author><author>Garraway, Levi A</author><author>Schreiber, Stuart L</author><author>Root, David E</author><author>Hahn, William C</author><author>Boehm, Jesse S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrated genetic and pharmacologic interrogation of rare cancers.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>11987</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>2041-1723</isbn><accession-num>27329820</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms11987</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Hong et al. - Nature communications - Integrated genetic and pharmacologic interrogation of rare cancers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11987.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27329820</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4917959</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Identifying therapeutic targets in rare cancers remains challenging due to the paucity of established models to perform preclinical studies.

Here, we confirm that this cell line recapitulates the histology and harbours the majority of the somatic genetic alterations found in a metastatic lesion isolated at first relapse. We then perform pooled CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi loss-of-function screens and a small-molecule screen focused on druggable cancer targets. Integrating these three complementary and orthogonal methods, we identify CDK4 and XPO1 as potential therapeutic targets in this cancer, which has no known alterations in these genes.

In general, we have taken two complementary approaches. In the first approach, we focus on perturbing genes identified as mutated, amplified, or deleted by cancer genome annotation efforts, whereas in the second, we have taken an unbiased approach to identify genes that are essential for cancer cell proliferation or survival in cell lines that are extensively annotated to identify context-specific essential genes.

Most KRAS-mutant cancers depend on sustained expression and signaling of KRAS, thus making it a high-priority therapeutic target. Unfortunately, development of direct small molecule inhibitors of KRAS function has been challenging. An alternative therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutant malignancies involves targeting codependent vulnerabilities or synthetic lethal partners that are preferentially essential in the setting of oncogenic KRAS. KRAS activates numerous effector pathways that mediate proliferation and survival signals. Moreover, cancer cells must cope with substantial oncogenic stress conferred by mutant KRAS. These oncogenic signaling pathways and compensatory coping mechanisms of KRAS-mutant cancer cells form the basis for synthetic lethal interactions. Here, we review the compendium of previously identified codependencies in KRAS-mutant cancers, including the results of numerous functional genetic screens aimed at identifying KRAS synthetic lethal targets. Importantly, many of these vulnerabilities may represent tractable therapeutic opportunities.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bullman, Susan</author><author>Pedamallu, Chandra S</author><author>Sicinska, Ewa</author><author>Clancy, Thomas E</author><author>Zhang, Xiaoyang</author><author>Cai, Diana</author><author>Neuberg, Donna</author><author>Huang, Katherine</author><author>Guevara, Fatima</author><author>Nelson, Timothy</author><author>Chipashvili, Otari</author><author>Hagan, Timothy</author><author>Walker, Mark</author><author>Ramachandran, Aruna</author><author>Diosdado, Begoña</author><author>Serna, Garazi</author><author>Mulet, Nuria</author><author>Landolfi, Stefania</author><author>Ramon Y Cajal, Santiago</author><author>Fasani, Roberta</author><author>Aguirre, Andrew J</author><author>Ng, Kimmie</author><author>Élez, Elena</author><author>Ogino, Shuji</author><author>Tabernero, Josep</author><author>Fuchs, Charles S</author><author>Hahn, William C</author><author>Nuciforo, Paolo</author><author>Meyerson, Matthew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of Fusobacterium persistence and antibiotic response in colorectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>1443-1448</pages><volume>358</volume><issue>6369</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>29170280</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.aal5240</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Bullman et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Analysis of Fusobacterium persistence and antibiotic response in colorectal cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/358/6369/1443.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29170280%0Ahttp://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5823247</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29170280</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.go</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Colorectal cancers comprise a complex mixture of malignant cells, nontransformed cells, and microorganisms. Fusobacterium nucleatum is among the most prevalent bacterial species in colorectal cancer tissues. Here we show that colonization of human colorectal cancers with Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome-including Bacteroides, Selenomonas, and Prevotella species-is maintained in distal metastases, demonstrating microbiome stability between paired primary and metastatic tumors. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Fusobacterium is predominantly associated with cancer cells in the metastatic lesions. Mouse xenografts of human primary colorectal adenocarcinomas were found to retain viable Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome through successive passages. Treatment of mice bearing a colon cancer xenograft with the antibiotic metronidazole reduced Fusobacterium load, cancer cell proliferation, and overall tumor growth. These observations argue for further investigation of antimicrobial interventions as a potential treatment for patients with Fusobacterium-associated colorectal cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsherniak, Aviad</author><author>Vazquez, Francisca</author><author>Montgomery, Phil G</author><author>Weir, Barbara A</author><author>Kryukov, Gregory</author><author>Cowley, Glenn S</author><author>Gill, Stanley</author><author>Harrington, William F</author><author>Pantel, Sasha</author><author>Krill-Burger, John M</author><author>Meyers, Robin M</author><author>Ali, Levi</author><author>Goodale, Amy</author><author>Lee, Yenarae</author><author>Jiang, Guozhi</author><author>Hsiao, Jessica</author><author>Gerath, William F J</author><author>Howell, Sara</author><author>Merkel, Erin</author><author>Ghandi, Mahmoud</author><author>Garraway, Levi A</author><author>Root, David E</author><author>Golub, Todd R</author><author>Boehm, Jesse S</author><author>Hahn, William C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Defining a Cancer Dependency Map.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>564-576.e16</pages><volume>170</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>RNAi screens</keyword><keyword>cancer dependencies</keyword><keyword>cancer targets</keyword><keyword>genetic vulnerabilities</keyword><keyword>genomic biomarkers</keyword><keyword>precision medicine</keyword><keyword>predictive modeling</keyword><keyword>seed effects</keyword><keyword>shRNA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc</publisher><isbn>9788599141038</isbn><accession-num>28753430</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2017.06.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Tsherniak et al. - Cell - Defining a Cancer Dependency Map.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.06.010</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28753430</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5667678</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Most human epithelial tumors harbor numerous alterations, making it difficult to predict which genes are required for tumor survival. To systematically identify cancer dependencies, we analyzed 501 genome-scale loss-of-function screens performed in diverse human cancer cell lines. We developed DEMETER, an analytical framework that segregates on- from off-target effects of RNAi. 769 genes were differentially required in subsets of these cell lines at a threshold of six SDs from the mean. We found predictive models for 426 dependencies (55%) by nonlinear regression modeling considering 66,646 molecular features. Many dependencies fall into a limited number of classes, and unexpectedly, in 82% of models, the top biomarkers were expression based. We demonstrated the basis behind one such predictive model linking hypermethylation of the UBB ubiquitin gene to a dependency on UBC. Together, these observations provide a foundation for a cancer dependency map that facilitates the prioritization of therapeutic targets.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Green, Shon</author><author>Trejo, Christy L</author><author>McMahon, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PIK3CA(H1047R) Accelerates and Enhances KRAS(G12D)-Driven Lung Tumorigenesis.</title><secondary-title>Cancer research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer research</full-title></periodical><pages>5378-91</pages><volume>75</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26567140</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1249</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Green, Trejo, McMahon - Cancer research - PIK3CA(H1047R) Accelerates and Enhances KRAS(G12D)-Driven Lung Tumorigenesis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/75/24/5378.full.pdf</url><url>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1249</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26567140</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4681648</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>KRAS-activating mutations drive human non-small cell lung cancer and initiate lung tumorigenesis in genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models. However, in a GEM model of KRAS(G12D)-induced lung cancer, tumors arise stochastically following a latency period, suggesting that additional events are required to promote early-stage tumorigenic expansion of KRAS(G12D)-mutated cells. PI3Kα (PIK3CA) is a direct effector of KRAS, but additional activation of PI3'-lipid signaling may be required to potentiate KRAS-driven lung tumorigenesis. Using GEM models, we tested whether PI3'-lipid signaling was limiting for the promotion of KRAS(G12D)-driven lung tumors by inducing the expression of KRAS(G12D) in the absence and presence of the activating PIK3CA(H1047R) mutation. PIK3CA(H1047R) expression alone failed to promote tumor formation, but dramatically enhanced tumorigenesis initiated by KRAS(G12D). We further observed that oncogenic cooperation between KRAS(G12D) and PIK3CA(H1047R) was accompanied by PI3Kα-mediated regulation of c-MYC, GSK3β, p27(KIP1), survivin, and components of the RB pathway, resulting in accelerated cell division of human or mouse lung cancer-derived cell lines. These data suggest that, although KRAS(G12D) may activate PI3Kα by direct biochemical mechanisms, PI3'-lipid signaling remains rate-limiting for the cell-cycle progression and expansion of early-stage KRAS(G12D)-initiated lung cells. Therefore, we provide a potential mechanistic rationale for the selection of KRAS and PIK3CA coactivating mutations in a number of human malignancies, with implications for the clinical deployment of PI3' kinase-targeted therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dimitrakopoulos, Christos</author><author>Hindupur, Sravanth Kumar</author><author>Häfliger, Luca</author><author>Behr, Jonas</author><author>Montazeri, Hesam</author><author>Hall, Michael N</author><author>Beerenwinkel, Niko</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Network-based integration of multi-omics data for prioritizing cancer genes.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>13674811 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>29547932</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bty148</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Dimitrakopoulos et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Network-based integration of multi-omics data for prioritizing cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty148/4934938</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29547932</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation Several molecular events are known to be cancer-related, including genomic aberrations, hypermethylation of gene promoter regions, and differential expression of microRNAs. These aberration events are very heterogeneous across tumors and it is poorly understood how they affect the molecular makeup of the cell, including the transcriptome and proteome. Protein interaction networks can help decode the functional relationship between aberration events and changes in gene and protein expression. Results We developed NetICS (Network-based Integration of Multi-omics Data), a new graph diffusion-based method for prioritizing cancer genes by integrating diverse molecular data types on a directed functional interaction network. NetICS prioritizes genes by their mediator effect, defined as the proximity of the gene to upstream aberration events and to downstream differentially expressed genes and proteins in an interaction network. Genes are prioritized for individual samples separately and integrated using a robust rank aggregation technique. NetICS provides a comprehensive computational framework that can aid in explaining the heterogeneity of aberration events by their functional convergence to common differentially expressed genes and proteins. We demonstrate NetICS' competitive performance in predicting known cancer genes and in generating robust gene lists using TCGA data from five cancer types.

We profiled transcriptomes of ∼6,000 single cells from 18 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, including five matched pairs of primary tumors and lymph node metastases. Stromal and immune cells had consistent expression programs across patients. Conversely, malignant cells varied within and between tumors in their expression of signatures related to cell cycle, stress, hypoxia, epithelial differentiation, and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (p-EMT). Cells expressing the p-EMT program spatially localized to the leading edge of primary tumors. By integrating single-cell transcriptomes with bulk expression profiles for hundreds of tumors, we refined HNSCC subtypes by their malignant and stromal composition and established p-EMT as an independent predictor of nodal metastasis, grade, and adverse pathologic features. Our results provide insight into the HNSCC ecosystem and define stromal interactions and a p-EMT program associated with metastasis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Navin, Nicholas E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The first five years of single-cell cancer genomics and beyond.</title><secondary-title>Genome research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome research</full-title></periodical><pages>1499-507</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1088-9051</isbn><accession-num>26430160</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.191098.115</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Navin - Genome research - The first five years of single-cell cancer genomics and beyond.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/10/1499.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26430160</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4579335</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Single-cell sequencing (SCS) is a powerful new tool for investigating evolution and diversity in cancer and understanding the role of rare cells in tumor progression.

In the coming years, SCS will greatly improve our understanding of invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance during cancer progression. These tools will also have direct translational applications in the clinic, in areas such as early detection, noninvasive monitoring, and guiding targeted therapy.

To understand the role of oncogenic KRAS in CRC, we engineered a mouse model of metastatic CRC that harbors an inducible oncogenic Kras allele (Kras mut ) and conditional null alleles of Apc and Trp53 (iKAP). The iKAP model recapitulates tumor progression from adenoma through metastases. Whole-exome sequencing revealed that the Kras mut allele was heterogenous in primary tumors yet homogenous in metastases, a pattern consistent with activated Kras mut signaling being a driver of progression to metastasis. System-level and functional analyses revealed the TGF-β pathway as a key mediator of Kras mut -driven invasiveness. Genetic extinction of Kras mut resulted in specific elimination of the Kras mut subpopulation in primary and metastatic tumors, leading to apoptotic elimination of advanced invasive and metastatic disease. This faithful CRC model provides genetic evidence that Kras mut drives CRC invasion and maintenance of metastases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guinney, Justin</author><author>Dienstmann, Rodrigo</author><author>Wang, Xin</author><author>de Reyniès, Aurélien</author><author>Schlicker, Andreas</author><author>Soneson, Charlotte</author><author>Marisa, Laetitia</author><author>Roepman, Paul</author><author>Nyamundanda, Gift</author><author>Angelino, Paolo</author><author>Bot, Brian M.</author><author>Morris, Jeffrey S.</author><author>Simon, Iris M.</author><author>Gerster, Sarah</author><author>Fessler, Evelyn</author><author>De Sousa E Melo, Felipe</author><author>Missiaglia, Edoardo</author><author>Ramay, Hena</author><author>Barras, David</author><author>Homicsko, Krisztian</author><author>Maru, Dipen</author><author>Manyam, Ganiraju C.</author><author>Broom, Bradley</author><author>Boige, Valerie</author><author>Perez-Villamil, Beatriz</author><author>Laderas, Ted</author><author>Salazar, Ramon</author><author>Gray, Joe W.</author><author>Hanahan, Douglas</author><author>Tabernero, Josep</author><author>Bernards, Rene</author><author>Friend, Stephen H.</author><author>Laurent-Puig, Pierre</author><author>Medema, Jan Paul</author><author>Sadanandam, Anguraj</author><author>Wessels, Lodewyk</author><author>Delorenzi, Mauro</author><author>Kopetz, Scott</author><author>Vermeulen, Louis</author><author>Tejpar, Sabine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The consensus molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nature medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1350-6</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1546-170X (Electronic)\r1078-8956 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>26457759</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nm.3967</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Guinney et al. - Nature medicine - The consensus molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26457759</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4636487</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently lethal disease with heterogeneous outcomes and drug responses. To resolve inconsistencies among the reported gene expression-based CRC classifications and facilitate clinical translation, we formed an international consortium dedicated to large-scale data sharing and analytics across expert groups. We show marked interconnectivity between six independent classification systems coalescing into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) with distinguishing features: CMS1 (microsatellite instability immune, 14%), hypermutated, microsatellite unstable and strong immune activation; CMS2 (canonical, 37%), epithelial, marked WNT and MYC signaling activation; CMS3 (metabolic, 13%), epithelial and evident metabolic dysregulation; and CMS4 (mesenchymal, 23%), prominent transforming growth factor-β activation, stromal invasion and angiogenesis. Samples with mixed features (13%) possibly represent a transition phenotype or intratumoral heterogeneity. We consider the CMS groups the most robust classification system currently available for CRC-with clear biological interpretability-and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morris, V K</author><author>Lucas, F A San</author><author>Overman, M J</author><author>Eng, C</author><author>Morelli, M P</author><author>Jiang, Z-Q</author><author>Luthra, R</author><author>Meric-Bernstam, F</author><author>Maru, D</author><author>Scheet, P</author><author>Kopetz, S</author><author>Vilar, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinicopathologic characteristics and gene expression analyses of non-KRAS 12/13, RAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>2008-14</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>colorectal cancer</keyword><keyword>gene expression</keyword><keyword>next-generation sequencing</keyword><keyword>survival</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25009008</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/annonc/mdu252</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Morris et al. - Annals of oncology official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology - Clinicopathologic characteris.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26457759</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4636487</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009008</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4176451</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 are present in ∼40% of all colorectal cancers (CRC). Activating mutations in codons 61 and 146 of KRAS and in codons 12, 13, and 61 of NRAS also occur but are less frequent. The clinicopathologic features and gene expression profiles of this latter subpopulation of RAS-mutant colorectal tumors have not yet been clearly defined but in general are treated similarly to those with KRAS 12 or 13 mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS Records of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center between December 2000 and August 2012 were reviewed for RAS (KRAS or NRAS) and BRAF mutation status, clinical characteristics, and survival outcomes. To study further with an independent cohort, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed to define a gene expression signature for patients whose tumors feature these atypical RAS mutations and explore differences with KRAS 12/13-mutated colorectal tumors. RESULTS Among the 484 patients reviewed, KRAS 12/13, KRAS 61/146, NRAS, and BRAF mutations were detected in 47.7%, 3.0%, 4.1%, and 7.4%, respectively, of patients who were tested for each of these aberrations. Lung metastases were more common in both the KRAS 12/13-mutated and atypical RAS-mutated cohorts relative to patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type tumors. Gene expression analyses revealed similar patterns regardless of the site of RAS mutation, and in silico functional algorithms predicted that KRAS and NRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, 61, and 146 alter the protein function and drive tumorgenesis. CONCLUSIONS Clinicopathologic characteristics, survival outcomes, functional impact, and gene expression profiling were similar between patients with KRAS 12/13 and those with NRAS or KRAS 61/146-mutated mCRC. These clinical and bioinformatic findings support the notion that colorectal tumors driven by these RAS mutations are phenotypically similar.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barbie, David A</author><author>Tamayo, Pablo</author><author>Boehm, Jesse S</author><author>Kim, So Young</author><author>Moody, Susan E</author><author>Dunn, Ian F</author><author>Schinzel, Anna C</author><author>Sandy, Peter</author><author>Meylan, Etienne</author><author>Scholl, Claudia</author><author>Fröhling, Stefan</author><author>Chan, Edmond M</author><author>Sos, Martin L</author><author>Michel, Kathrin</author><author>Mermel, Craig</author><author>Silver, Serena J</author><author>Weir, Barbara A</author><author>Reiling, Jan H</author><author>Sheng, Qing</author><author>Gupta, Piyush B</author><author>Wadlow, Raymond C</author><author>Le, Hanh</author><author>Hoersch, Sebastian</author><author>Wittner, Ben S</author><author>Ramaswamy, Sridhar</author><author>Livingston, David M</author><author>Sabatini, David M</author><author>Meyerson, Matthew</author><author>Thomas, Roman K</author><author>Lander, Eric S</author><author>Mesirov, Jill P</author><author>Root, David E</author><author>Gilliland, D Gary</author><author>Jacks, Tyler</author><author>Hahn, William C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systematic RNA interference reveals that oncogenic KRAS-driven cancers require TBK1.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>108-12</pages><volume>462</volume><issue>7269</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>1476-4687 (Electronic)\r0028-0836 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>19847166</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature08460</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Barbie et al. - Nature - Systematic RNA interference reveals that oncogenic KRAS-driven cancers require TBK1.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08460.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19847166</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2783335</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The proto-oncogene KRAS is mutated in a wide array of human cancers, most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to standard therapies. Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele. Here we have used systematic RNA interference to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical IkappaB kinase TBK1 was selectively essential in cells that contain mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF-kappaB anti-apoptotic signals involving c-Rel and BCL-XL (also known as BCL2L1) that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations indicate that TBK1 and NF-kappaB signalling are essential in KRAS mutant tumours, and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, J.

These mutations occur primarily at codon 12 and less frequently at codons 13 and 61. Although some studies have suggested that different KRAS mutations may have variable oncogenic properties, to date there has been no comprehensive functional comparison of multiple KRAS mutations in an in vivo vertebrate tumorigenesis system. We generated a Gal4/UAS-based zebrafish model of pancreatic tumorigenesis in which the pancreatic expression of UAS-regulated oncogenes is driven by a ptf1a:Gal4-VP16 driver line. This system allowed us to rapidly compare the ability of 12 different KRAS mutations (G12A, G12C, G12D, G12F, G12R, G12S, G12V, G13C, G13D, Q61L, Q61R and A146T) to drive pancreatic tumorigenesis in vivo. Among fish injected with one of five KRAS mutations reported in other tumor types but not in human pancreatic cancer, 2/79 (2.5%) developed pancreatic tumors, with both tumors arising in fish injected with A146T. In contrast, among fish injected with one of seven KRAS mutations known to occur in human pancreatic cancer, 22/106 (20.8%) developed pancreatic cancer. All eight tumorigenic KRAS mutations were associated with downstream MAPK/ERK pathway activation in preneoplastic pancreatic epithelium, whereas nontumorigenic mutations were not. These results suggest that the spectrum of KRAS mutations observed in human pancreatic cancer reflects selection based on variable tumorigenic capacities, including the ability to activate MAPK/ERK signaling.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tomasetti, Cristian</author><author>Marchionni, Luigi</author><author>Nowak, Martin A</author><author>Parmigiani, Giovanni</author><author>Vogelstein, Bert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Only three driver gene mutations are required for the development of lung and colorectal cancers.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>118-23</pages><volume>112</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>cancer</keyword><keyword>cancer evolution</keyword><keyword>cancer incidence</keyword><keyword>driver mutations</keyword><keyword>somatic mutation rate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><accession-num>25535351</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1421839112</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Tomasetti et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Only three driver gene mutat.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2014223.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065594</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4836617</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25535351</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancer arises through the sequential accumulation of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, how many such mutations are required for a normal human cell to progress to an advanced cancer? The best estimates for this number have been provided by mathematical models based on the relation between age and incidence. For example, the classic studies of Nordling [Nordling CO (1953) Br J Cancer 7(1):68-72] and Armitage and Doll [Armitage P, Doll R (1954) Br J Cancer 8(1):1-12] suggest that six or seven sequential mutations are required. Here, we describe a different approach to derive this estimate that combines conventional epidemiologic studies with genome-wide sequencing data: incidence data for different groups of patients with the same cancer type were compared with respect to their somatic mutation rates. In two well-documented cancer types (lung and colon adenocarcinomas), we find that only three sequential mutations are required to develop cancer. This conclusion deepens our understanding of the process of carcinogenesis and has important implications for the design of future cancer genome-sequencing efforts.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Trapnell, Cole</author><author>Hendrickson, David G</author><author>Sauvageau, Martin</author><author>Goff, Loyal</author><author>Rinn, John L</author><author>Pachter, Lior</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential analysis of gene regulation at transcript resolution with RNA-seq.</title><secondary-title>Nature biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>46-53</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1750279917502799</isbn><accession-num>23222703</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nbt.2450</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Trapnell et al. - Nature biotechnology - Differential analysis of gene regulation at transcript resolution with RNA-seq.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2450.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23222703</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3869392</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Differential analysis of gene and transcript expression using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is complicated by several sources of measurement variability and poses numerous statistical challenges. We present Cuffdiff 2, an algorithm that estimates expression at transcript-level resolution and controls for variability evident across replicate libraries. Cuffdiff 2 robustly identifies differentially expressed transcripts and genes and reveals differential splicing and promoter-preference changes. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle. Cuffdiff 2 performs robust differential analysis in RNA-seq experiments at transcript resolution, revealing a layer of regulation not readily observable with other high-throughput technologies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Xi</author><author>Ayala, Iriscilla</author><author>Shannon, Chris</author><author>Fourcaudot, Marcel</author><author>Acharya, Nikhil K</author><author>Jenkinson, Christopher P</author><author>Heikkinen, Sami</author><author>Norton, Luke</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Diabetes Gene and Wnt Pathway Effector TCF7L2 Regulates Adipocyte Development and Function.</title><secondary-title>Diabetes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Diabetes</full-title></periodical><pages>554-568</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29317436</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2337/db17-0318</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Chen et al. - Diabetes - The Diabetes Gene and Wnt Pathway Effector TCF7L2 Regulates Adipocyte Development and Function.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/diabetes/67/4/554.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29317436</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5860863</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The gene encoding for transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the strongest type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) candidate gene discovered to date. The TCF7L2 protein is a key transcriptional effector of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is an important developmental pathway that negatively regulates adipogenesis. However, the precise role that TCF7L2 plays in the development and function of adipocytes remains largely unknown. Using a combination of in vitro approaches, we first show that TCF7L2 protein is increased during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and primary adipocyte stem cells and that TCF7L2 expression is required for the regulation of Wnt signaling during adipogenesis. Inactivation of TCF7L2 protein by removing the high-mobility group (HMG)-box DNA binding domain in mature adipocytes in vivo leads to whole-body glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance. This phenotype is associated with increased subcutaneous adipose tissue mass, adipocyte hypertrophy, and inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that TCF7L2 mRNA expression is downregulated in humans with impaired glucose tolerance and adipocyte insulin resistance, highlighting the translational potential of these findings. In summary, our data indicate that TCF7L2 has key roles in adipose tissue development and function that may reveal, at least in part, how TCF7L2 contributes to the pathophysiology of T2DM.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wei, Lin</author><author>Jin, Zhilin</author><author>Yang, Shengjie</author><author>Xu, Yanxun</author><author>Zhu, Yitan</author><author>Ji, Yuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>TCGA-assembler 2: software pipeline for retrieval and processing of TCGA/CPTAC data.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>1615-1617</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29272348</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btx812</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Wei et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - TCGA-assembler 2 software pipeline for retrieval and processing of TCGACPTAC data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.compgenome.org/TCGA-Assembler/</url><url>https://githu</url><url>http://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx812/4764001</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29272348</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program has produced huge amounts of cancer genomics data providing unprecedented opportunities for research. In 2014, we developed TCGA-Assembler, a software pipeline for retrieval and processing of public TCGA data. In 2016, TCGA data were transferred from the TCGA data portal to the Genomic Data Commons (GDCs), which is supported by a different set of data storage and retrieval mechanisms. In addition, new proteomics data of TCGA samples have been generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) program, which were not available for downloading through TCGA-Assembler. It is desirable to acquire and integrate data from both GDC and CPTAC. Results We develop TCGA-assembler 2 (TA2) to automatically download and integrate data from GDC and CPTAC. We make substantial improvement on the functionality of TA2 to enhance user experience and software performance. TA2 together with its previous version have helped more than 2000 researchers from 64 countries to access and utilize TCGA and CPTAC data in their research. Availability of TA2 will continue to allow existing and new users to conduct reproducible research based on TCGA and CPTAC data.

However, the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) remains understudied. We hypothesize that 5hmC mediates redox regulation of gene expression in an aggressive subtype known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To address this, our objective was to highlight genes that may be the target of this process by identifying redox-regulated, antioxidant-sensitive, gene-localized 5hmC changes associated with mRNA changes in TNBC cells. Results We proceeded to develop an approach to integrate novel Pvu-sequencing and RNA-sequencing data. The result of our approach to merge genome-wide, high-throughput TNBC cell line datasets to identify significant, concordant 5hmC and mRNA changes in response to antioxidant treatment produced a gene set with relevance to cancer stem cell function. Moreover, we have established a method that will be useful for continued research of 5hmC in TNBC cells and tissue samples.

We used single-cell whole-genome sequencing to perform genome-wide somatic single-nucleotide variant (sSNV) identification on DNA from 161 single neurons from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of 15 normal individuals (aged 4 months to 82 years), as well as 9 individuals affected by early-onset neurodegeneration due to genetic disorders of DNA repair (Cockayne syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum). sSNVs increased approximately linearly with age in both areas (with a higher rate in hippocampus) and were more abundant in neurodegenerative disease. The accumulation of somatic mutations with age-which we term genosenium-shows age-related, region-related, and disease-related molecular signatures and may be important in other human age-associated conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blair, Kris M</author><author>Turner, Linda</author><author>Winkelman, Jared T</author><author>Berg, Howard C</author><author>Kearns, Daniel B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>in the Bacillus subtilis Biofilm</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1636-1638</pages><volume>320</volume><issue>June</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><isbn>1095-9203</isbn><accession-num>18566286</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1157877</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2008 - Blair et al. - Science - in the Bacillus subtilis Biofilm.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Biofilms are multicellular aggregates of sessile bacteria encased by an extracellular matrix and are important medically as a source of drug-resistant microbes. In Bacillus subtilis, we found that an operon required for biofilm matrix biosynthesis also encoded an inhibitor of motility, EpsE. EpsE arrested flagellar rotation in a manner similar to that of a clutch, by disengaging motor force-generating elements in cells embedded in the biofilm matrix. The clutch is a simple, rapid, and potentially reversible form of motility control.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Bing</author><author>Wang, Jing</author><author>Wang, Xiaojing</author><author>Zhu, Jing</author><author>Liu, Qi</author><author>Shi, Zhiao</author><author>Chambers, Matthew C</author><author>Zimmerman, Lisa J</author><author>Shaddox, Kent F</author><author>Kim, Sangtae</author><author>Davies, Sherri R</author><author>Wang, Sean</author><author>Wang, Pei</author><author>Kinsinger, Christopher R</author><author>Rivers, Robert C</author><author>Rodriguez, Henry</author><author>Townsend, R Reid</author><author>Ellis, Matthew J C</author><author>Carr, Steven A</author><author>Tabb, David L</author><author>Coffey, Robert J</author><author>Slebos, Robbert J C</author><author>Liebler, Daniel C</author><author>NCI CPTAC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Proteogenomic characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>382-7</pages><volume>513</volume><issue>7518</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1476-4687 (Electronic)\r0028-0836 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>25043054</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature13438</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Zhang et al. - Nature - Proteogenomic characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13438.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25043054</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4249766</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Extensive genomic characterization of human cancers presents the problem of inference from genomic abnormalities to cancer phenotypes. To address this problem, we analysed proteomes of colon and rectal tumours characterized previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and perform integrated proteogenomic analyses. Somatic variants displayed reduced protein abundance compared to germline variants. Messenger RNA transcript abundance did not reliably predict protein abundance differences between tumours. Proteomics identified five proteomic subtypes in the TCGA cohort, two of which overlapped with the TCGA 'microsatellite instability/CpG island methylation phenotype' transcriptomic subtype, but had distinct mutation, methylation and protein expression patterns associated with different clinical outcomes. Although copy number alterations showed strong cis- and trans-effects on mRNA abundance, relatively few of these extend to the protein level. Thus, proteomics data enabled prioritization of candidate driver genes. The chromosome 20q amplicon was associated with the largest global changes at both mRNA and protein levels; proteomics data highlighted potential 20q candidates, including HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha), TOMM34 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34) and SRC (SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase). Integrated proteogenomic analysis provides functional context to interpret genomic abnormalities and affords a new paradigm for understanding cancer biology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cancer Genome Atlas Network</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>330-7</pages><volume>487</volume><issue>7407</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>1476-4687 (Electronic)\n0028-0836 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>22810696</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature11252</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Cancer Genome Atlas Network - Nature - Comprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11252.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22810696</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3401966</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal carcinoma, we conducted a genome-scale analysis of 276 samples, analysing exome sequence, DNA copy number, promoter methylation and messenger RNA and microRNA expression. A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase ε (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Uhlén, Mathias</author><author>Hallström, Björn M</author><author>Lindskog, Cecilia</author><author>Mardinoglu, Adil</author><author>Pontén, Fredrik</author><author>Nielsen, Jens</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transcriptomics resources of human tissues and organs.</title><secondary-title>Molecular systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>862</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>genome‐scale metabolic models</keyword><keyword>proteomics</keyword><keyword>transcriptomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>10.15252/msb.20155865</isbn><accession-num>27044256</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.15252/msb.20155865</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Uhlén et al. - Molecular systems biology - Transcriptomics resources of human tissues and organs.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11252.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22810696</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3401966</url><url>http://msb.embopress.org/cgi/doi/10.15252/msb.20155865</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2704</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Quantifying the differential expression of genes in various human organs, tissues, and cell types is vital to understand human physiology and disease. Recently, several large-scale transcriptomics studies have analyzed the expression of protein-coding genes across tissues. These datasets provide a framework for defining the molecular constituents of the human body as well as for generating comprehensive lists of proteins expressed across tissues or in a tissue-restricted manner. Here, we review publicly available human transcriptome resources and discuss body-wide data from independent genome-wide transcriptome analyses of different tissues. Gene expression measurements from these independent datasets, generated using samples from fresh frozen surgical specimens and postmortem tissues, are consistent. Overall, the different genome-wide analyses support a distribution in which many proteins are found in all tissues and relatively few in a tissue-restricted manner. Moreover, we discuss the applications of publicly available omics data for building genome-scale metabolic models, used for analyzing cell and tissue functions both in physiological and in disease contexts.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sangaralingam, Ajanthah</author><author>Dayem Ullah, Abu Z</author><author>Marzec, Jacek</author><author>Gadaleta, Emanuela</author><author>Nagano, Ai</author><author>Ross-Adams, Helen</author><author>Wang, Jun</author><author>Lemoine, Nicholas R</author><author>Chelala, Claude</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>'Multi-omic' data analysis using O-miner.</title><secondary-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>O-miner</keyword><keyword>data analysis</keyword><keyword>data integration</keyword><keyword>multi-omics</keyword><keyword>sequencing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28981577</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bib/bbx080</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Sangaralingam et al. - Briefings in bioinformatics - 'Multi-omic' data analysis using O-miner.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28981577</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Innovations in -omics technologies have driven advances in biomedical research. However, integrating and analysing the large volumes of data generated from different high-throughput -omics technologies remain a significant challenge to basic and clinical scientists without bioinformatics skills or access to bioinformatics support. To address this demand, we have significantly updated our previous O-miner analytical suite, to incorporate several new features and data types to provide an efficient and easy-to-use Web tool for the automated analysis of data from '-omics' technologies. Created from a biologist's perspective, this tool allows for the automated analysis of large and complex transcriptomic, genomic and methylomic data sets, together with biological/clinical information, to identify significantly altered pathways and prioritize novel biomarkers/targets for biological validation. Our resource can be used to analyse both in-house data and the huge amount of publicly available information from array and sequencing platforms. Multiple data sets can be easily combined, allowing for meta-analyses. Here, we describe the analytical pipelines currently available in O-miner and present examples of use to demonstrate its utility and relevance in maximizing research output. O-miner Web server is free to use and is available at http://www.o-miner.org.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berger, Bonnie</author><author>Peng, Jian</author><author>Singh, Mona</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computational solutions for omics data.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

The gene-annotation enrichment analysis is a promising high-throughput strategy that increases the likelihood for investigators to identify biological processes most pertinent to their study. Approximately 68 bioinformatics enrichment tools that are currently available in the community are collected in this survey. Tools are uniquely categorized into three major classes, according to their underlying enrichment algorithms. The comprehensive collections, unique tool classifications and associated questions/issues will provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date view regarding the advantages, pitfalls and recent trends in a simpler tool-class level rather than by a tool-by-tool approach. Thus, the survey will help tool designers/developers and experienced end users understand the underlying algorithms and pertinent details of particular tool categories/tools, enabling them to make the best choices for their particular research interests.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Subramanian, Aravind</author><author>Tamayo, Pablo</author><author>Mootha, Vamsi K.</author><author>Mukherjee, Sayan</author><author>Ebert, Benjamin L.</author><author>Gillette, Michael A.</author><author>Paulovich, Amanda</author><author>Pomeroy, Scott L.</author><author>Golub, Todd R.</author><author>Lander, Eric S.</author><author>Mesirov, Jill P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title></periodical><pages>15545-50</pages><volume>102</volume><issue>43</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><isbn>0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>16199517</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.0506580102</electronic-resource-num><notes>GSEA paper</notes><research-notes>GSEA paper</research-notes><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2005 - Subramanian et al. - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America - Gene set enrichment analys.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0506580102</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16199517</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1239896</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Litichevskiy, Lev</author><author>Peckner, Ryan</author><author>Abelin, Jennifer G</author><author>Asiedu, Jacob K</author><author>Creech, Amanda L</author><author>Davis, John F</author><author>Davison, Desiree</author><author>Dunning, Caitlin M</author><author>Egertson, Jarrett D</author><author>Egri, Shawn</author><author>Gould, Joshua</author><author>Ko, Tak</author><author>Johnson, Sarah A</author><author>Lahr, David L</author><author>Lam, Daniel</author><author>Liu, Zihan</author><author>Lyons, Nicholas J</author><author>Lu, Xiaodong</author><author>MacLean, Brendan X</author><author>Mungenast, Alison E</author><author>Officer, Adam</author><author>Natoli, Ted E</author><author>Papanastasiou, Malvina</author><author>Patel, Jinal</author><author>Sharma, Vagisha</author><author>Toder, Courtney</author><author>Tubelli, Andrew A</author><author>Young, Jennie Z</author><author>Carr, Steven A</author><author>Golub, Todd R</author><author>Subramanian, Aravind</author><author>MacCoss, Michael J</author><author>Tsai, Li-Huei</author><author>Jaffe, Jacob D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Library of Phosphoproteomic and Chromatin Signatures for Characterizing Cellular Responses to Drug Perturbations.</title><secondary-title>Cell systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell systems</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>GCP</keyword><keyword>L1000</keyword><keyword>LINCS project</keyword><keyword>P100</keyword><keyword>drug discovery</keyword><keyword>epigenetics</keyword><keyword>mass spectrometry</keyword><keyword>mechanism of action</keyword><keyword>proteomics</keyword><keyword>signaling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29655704</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Litichevskiy et al. - Cell systems - A Library of Phosphoproteomic and Chromatin Signatures for Characterizing Cellular Responses.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29655704</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Although the value of proteomics has been demonstrated, cost and scale are typically prohibitive, and gene expression profiling remains dominant for characterizing cellular responses to perturbations. However, high-throughput sentinel assays provide an opportunity for proteomics to contribute at a meaningful scale. We present a systematic library resource (90 drugs × 6 cell lines) of proteomic signatures that measure changes in the reduced-representation phosphoproteome (P100) and changes in epigenetic marks on histones (GCP). A majority of these drugs elicited reproducible signatures, but notable cell line- and assay-specific differences were observed. Using the &quot;connectivity&quot; framework, we compared signatures across cell types and integrated data across assays, including a transcriptional assay (L1000). Consistent connectivity among cell types revealed cellular responses that transcended lineage, and consistent connectivity among assays revealed unexpected associations between drugs. We further leveraged the resource against public data to formulate hypotheses for treatment of multiple myeloma and acute lymphocytic leukemia. This resource is publicly available at https://clue.io/proteomics.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dekker, Job</author><author>Belmont, Andrew S.</author><author>Guttman, Mitchell</author><author>Leshyk, Victor O.</author><author>Lis, John T.</author><author>Lomvardas, Stavros</author><author>Mirny, Leonid A.</author><author>O'Shea, Clodagh C.</author><author>Park, Peter J.</author><author>Ren, Bing</author><author>Politz, Joan C Ritland</author><author>Shendure, Jay</author><author>Zhong, Sheng</author><author>4D Nucleome Network</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 4D nucleome project.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>219-226</pages><volume>549</volume><issue>7671</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>9780128022924</isbn><accession-num>28905911</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature23884</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Dekker et al. - Nature - The 4D nucleome project.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28905911</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5617335</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The 4D Nucleome Network aims to develop and apply approaches to map the structure and dynamics of the human and mouse genomes in space and time with the goal of gaining deeper mechanistic insights into how the nucleus is organized and functions.

Although MSI has been studied for decades, large amounts of sequencing data now available allows us to examine the molecular fingerprints of MSI in greater detail. Here, we analyse ∼8,000 exomes and ∼1,000 whole genomes of cancer patients across 23 cancer types. Our analysis reveals that the frequency of MSI events is highly variable within and across tumour types. We also identify genes in DNA repair and oncogenic pathways recurrently subject to MSI and uncover non-coding loci that frequently display MSI. Finally, we propose a highly accurate exome-based predictive model for the MSI phenotype. These results advance our understanding of the genomic drivers and consequences of MSI, and our comprehensive catalogue of tumour-type-specific MSI loci will enable panel-based MSI testing to identify patients who are likely to benefit from immunotherapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sherman, Maxwell A.</author><author>Barton, Alison R.</author><author>Lodato, Michael A.</author><author>Vitzthum, Carl</author><author>Coulter, Michael E.</author><author>Walsh, Christopher A.</author><author>Park, Peter J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PaSD-qc: quality control for single cell whole-genome sequencing data using power spectral density estimation.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>e20</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29186545</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkx1195</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Sherman et al. - Nucleic acids research - PaSD-qc quality control for single cell whole-genome sequencing data using power spectr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkx1195/4658833</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29186545</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5829578</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Single cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) is providing novel insights into the nature of genetic heterogeneity in normal and diseased cells. However, the whole-genome amplification process required for scWGS introduces biases into the resulting sequencing that can confound downstream analysis. Here, we present a statistical method, with an accompanying package PaSD-qc (Power Spectral Density-qc), that evaluates the properties and quality of single cell libraries. It uses a modified power spectral density to assess amplification uniformity, amplicon size distribution, autocovariance and inter-sample consistency as well as to identify chromosomes with aberrant read-density profiles due either to copy alterations or poor amplification. These metrics provide a standard way to compare the quality of single cell samples as well as yield information necessary to improve variant calling strategies. We demonstrate the usefulness of this tool in comparing the properties of scWGS protocols, identifying potential chromosomal copy number variation, determining chromosomal and subchromosomal regions of poor amplification, and selecting high-quality libraries from low-coverage data for deep sequencing. The software is available free and open-source at https://github.com/parklab/PaSDqc.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krummenacker, Markus</author><author>Paley, Suzanne</author><author>Mueller, Lukas</author><author>Yan, Thomas</author><author>Karp, Peter D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Querying and computing with BioCyc databases.</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>3454-5</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><isbn>1367-4803 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>15961440</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bti546</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2005 - Krummenacker et al. - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) - Querying and computing with BioCyc databases.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15961440</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1450015</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We describe multiple methods for accessing and querying the complex and integrated cellular data in the BioCyc family of databases: access through multiple file formats, access through Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for LISP, Perl and Java, and SQL access through the BioWarehouse relational database.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ament, Seth A</author><author>Pearl, Jocelynn R</author><author>Cantle, Jeffrey P</author><author>Bragg, Robert M</author><author>Skene, Peter J</author><author>Coffey, Sydney R</author><author>Bergey, Dani E</author><author>Wheeler, Vanessa C</author><author>MacDonald, Marcy E</author><author>Baliga, Nitin S</author><author>Rosinski, Jim</author><author>Hood, Leroy E</author><author>Carroll, Jeffrey B</author><author>Price, Nathan D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transcriptional regulatory networks underlying gene expression changes in Huntington's disease.</title><secondary-title>Molecular systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e7435</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Huntington's disease</keyword><keyword>SMAD3</keyword><keyword>transcription factor</keyword><keyword>transcriptional regulatory networks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29581148</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.15252/MSB.20167435</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Ament et al. - Molecular systems biology - Transcriptional regulatory networks underlying gene expression changes in Huntington's.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581148</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5868199</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Transcriptional changes occur presymptomatically and throughout Huntington's disease (HD), motivating the study of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) in HD We reconstructed a genome-scale model for the target genes of 718 transcription factors (TFs) in the mouse striatum by integrating a model of genomic binding sites with transcriptome profiling of striatal tissue from HD mouse models. We identified 48 differentially expressed TF-target gene modules associated with age- and CAG repeat length-dependent gene expression changes in Htt CAG knock-in mouse striatum and replicated many of these associations in independent transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. Thirteen of 48 of these predicted TF-target gene modules were also differentially expressed in striatal tissue from human disease. We experimentally validated a specific model prediction that SMAD3 regulates HD-related gene expression changes using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) of mouse striatum.

The need to investigate a system, not only as individual components but as a whole, emerges. This can be done by examining the elementary constituents individually and then how these are connected. The myriad components of a system and their interactions are best characterized as networks and they are mainly represented as graphs where thousands of nodes are connected with thousands of vertices. In this article we demonstrate approaches, models and methods from the graph theory universe and we discuss ways in which they can be used to reveal hidden properties and features of a network.

Here, we leverage Drop-seq, a massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach, to individually profile 20,000 progenitor cells from human cord blood, without prior enrichment or depletion for individual lineages based on surface markers. Our data reveal a transcriptional compendium of progenitor states in human cord blood, representing four committed lineages downstream from HSC, alongside the transcriptional dynamics underlying fate commitment. We identify intermediate stages that simultaneously co-express &quot;primed&quot; programs for multiple downstream lineages, and also observe striking heterogeneity in the early molecular transitions between myeloid subsets. Integrating our data with a recently published scRNA-seq dataset from human bone marrow, we illustrate the molecular similarity between these two commonly used systems and further explore the chromatin dynamics of &quot;primed&quot; transcriptional programs based on ATAC-seq. Finally, we demonstrate that Drop-seq data can be utilized to identify new heterogeneous surface markers of cell state that correlate with functional output.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buljan, Marija</author><author>Blattmann, Peter</author><author>Aebersold, Ruedi</author><author>Boutros, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systematic characterization of pan-cancer mutation clusters.</title><secondary-title>Molecular systems biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular systems biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e7974</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>cancer genomics</keyword><keyword>hotspot analysis</keyword><keyword>interface mutations</keyword><keyword>protein complexes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29572294</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.15252/msb.20177974</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Buljan et al. - Molecular systems biology - Systematic characterization of pan-cancer mutation clusters.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://msb.embopress.org/lookup/doi/10.15252/msb.20177974</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29572294</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5866917</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cancer genome sequencing has shown that driver genes can often be distinguished not only by the elevated mutation frequency but also by specific nucleotide positions that accumulate changes at a high rate. However, properties associated with a residue's potential to drive tumorigenesis when mutated have not yet been systematically investigated. Here, using a novel methodological approach, we identify and characterize a compendium of 180 hotspot residues within 160 human proteins which occur with a significant frequency and are likely to have functionally relevant impact. We find that such mutations (i) are more prominent in proteins that can exist in the on and off state, (ii) reflect the identity of a tumor of origin, and (iii) often localize within interfaces which mediate interactions with other proteins or ligands. Following, we further examine structural data for human protein complexes and identify a number of additional protein interfaces that accumulate cancer mutations at a high rate. Jointly, these analyses suggest that disruption and dysregulation of protein interactions can be instrumental in switching functions of cancer proteins and activating downstream changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yip, Andy M</author><author>Horvath, Steve</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gene network interconnectedness and the generalized topological overlap measure.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>22</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>1471-2105</isbn><accession-num>17250769</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-8-22</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2007 - Yip, Horvath - BMC bioinformatics - Gene network interconnectedness and the generalized topological overlap measure.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1797055/pdf/1471-2105-8-22.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17250769</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1797055</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Network methods are increasingly used to represent the interactions of genes and/or proteins. Genes or proteins that are directly linked may have a similar biological function or may be part of the same biological pathway. Since the information on the connection (adjacency) between 2 nodes may be noisy or incomplete, it can be desirable to consider alternative measures of pairwise interconnectedness. Here we study a class of measures that are proportional to the number of neighbors that a pair of nodes share in common. For example, the topological overlap measure by Ravasz et al. 1 can be interpreted as a measure of agreement between the m = 1 step neighborhoods of 2 nodes. Several studies have shown that two proteins having a higher topological overlap are more likely to belong to the same functional class than proteins having a lower topological overlap. Here we address the question whether a measure of topological overlap based on higher-order neighborhoods could give rise to a more robust and sensitive measure of interconnectedness. RESULTS We generalize the topological overlap measure from m = 1 step neighborhoods to m &gt; or = 2 step neighborhoods. This allows us to define the m-th order generalized topological overlap measure (GTOM) by (i) counting the number of m-step neighbors that a pair of nodes share and (ii) normalizing it to take a value between 0 and 1. Using theoretical arguments, a yeast co-expression network application, and a fly protein network application, we illustrate the usefulness of the proposed measure for module detection and gene neighborhood analysis. CONCLUSION Topological overlap can serve as an important filter to counter the effects of spurious or missing connections between network nodes. The m-th order topological overlap measure allows one to trade-off sensitivity versus specificity when it comes to defining pairwise interconnectedness and network modules.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Bin</author><author>Horvath, Steve</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis.</title><secondary-title>Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>Article17</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><isbn>1544-6115 (Electronic)\r1544-6115 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>16646834</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2202/1544-6115.1128</electronic-resource-num><notes>similarity = level of agreement between gene expression profiles

The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Szklarczyk, Damian</author><author>Franceschini, Andrea</author><author>Wyder, Stefan</author><author>Forslund, Kristoffer</author><author>Heller, Davide</author><author>Huerta-Cepas, Jaime</author><author>Simonovic, Milan</author><author>Roth, Alexander</author><author>Santos, Alberto</author><author>Tsafou, Kalliopi P</author><author>Kuhn, Michael</author><author>Bork, Peer</author><author>Jensen, Lars J</author><author>von Mering, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>STRING v10: protein-protein interaction networks, integrated over the tree of life.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D447-52</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>Database issue</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>13624962 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>25352553</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gku1003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Szklarczyk et al. - Nucleic acids research - STRING v10 protein-protein interaction networks, integrated over the tree of life.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383874/pdf/gku1003.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25352553</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4383874</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The many functional partnerships and interactions that occur between proteins are at the core of cellular processing and their systematic characterization helps to provide context in molecular systems biology. However, known and predicted interactions are scattered over multiple resources, and the available data exhibit notable differences in terms of quality and completeness. The STRING database (http://string-db.org) aims to provide a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) associations. The new version 10.0 of STRING covers more than 2000 organisms, which has necessitated novel, scalable algorithms for transferring interaction information between organisms. For this purpose, we have introduced hierarchical and self-consistent orthology annotations for all interacting proteins, grouping the proteins into families at various levels of phylogenetic resolution. Further improvements in version 10.0 include a completely redesigned prediction pipeline for inferring protein-protein associations from co-expression data, an API interface for the R computing environment and improved statistical analysis for enrichment tests in user-provided networks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerami, Ethan G</author><author>Gross, Benjamin E</author><author>Demir, Emek</author><author>Rodchenkov, Igor</author><author>Babur, Ozgün</author><author>Anwar, Nadia</author><author>Schultz, Nikolaus</author><author>Bader, Gary D</author><author>Sander, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pathway Commons, a web resource for biological pathway data.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D685-90</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>Database issue</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1362-4962 (Electronic)\r0305-1048 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>21071392</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkq1039</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2011 - Cerami et al. - Nucleic acids research - Pathway Commons, a web resource for biological pathway data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3013659/pdf/gkq1039.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21071392</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3013659</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Pathway Commons (http://www.pathwaycommons.org) is a collection of publicly available pathway data from multiple organisms.

Studying how this is performed in a context and cell type specific way is essential to understand signaling both in physiological and diseased situations. Context-specific medium/high throughput proteomic data measured upon perturbation is now relatively easy to obtain but formalisms that can take advantage of these features to build models of signaling are still comparatively scarce. RESULTS Here we present CellNOptR, an open-source R software package for building predictive logic models of signaling networks by training networks derived from prior knowledge to signaling (typically phosphoproteomic) data. CellNOptR features different logic formalisms, from Boolean models to differential equations, in a common framework. These different logic model representations accommodate state and time values with increasing levels of detail. We provide in addition an interface via Cytoscape (CytoCopteR) to facilitate use and integration with Cytoscape network-based capabilities. CONCLUSIONS Models generated with this pipeline have two key features. First, they are constrained by prior knowledge about the network but trained to data. They are therefore context and cell line specific, which results in enhanced predictive and mechanistic insights. Second, they can be built using different logic formalisms depending on the richness of the available data. Models built with CellNOptR are useful tools to understand how signals are processed by cells and how this is altered in disease. They can be used to predict the effect of perturbations (individual or in combinations), and potentially to engineer therapies that have differential effects/side effects depending on the cell type or context.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karp, Peter D</author><author>Paley, Suzanne M</author><author>Krummenacker, Markus</author><author>Latendresse, Mario</author><author>Dale, Joseph M</author><author>Lee, Thomas J</author><author>Kaipa, Pallavi</author><author>Gilham, Fred</author><author>Spaulding, Aaron</author><author>Popescu, Liviu</author><author>Altman, Tomer</author><author>Paulsen, Ian</author><author>Keseler, Ingrid M</author><author>Caspi, Ron</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pathway Tools version 13.0: integrated software for pathway/genome informatics and systems biology.</title><secondary-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Briefings in bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>40-79</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>10</keyword><keyword>1093</keyword><keyword>2 december 2009</keyword><keyword>40</keyword><keyword>79</keyword><keyword>advance access published on</keyword><keyword>bbp043</keyword><keyword>bib</keyword><keyword>doi</keyword><keyword>iefings in bioinf ormatics</keyword><keyword>no 1</keyword><keyword>vol 11</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1477-4054 (Electronic)\r1467-5463 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>19955237</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bib/bbp043</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Karp et al. - Briefings in bioinformatics - Pathway Tools version 13.0 integrated software for pathwaygenome informatics and syst.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://watermark.silverchair.com/bbp043.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAZswggGXBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGIMIIBhAIBADCCAX0GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMBX0gzXr-3BVp_iKpAgEQgIIBTpb_wesXBhbRn_32oFf6EQR2QKDwOA9kklama0qWgZZpuLv4</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Pathway Tools is a production-quality software environment for creating a type of model-organism database called a Pathway/Genome Database (PGDB). A PGDB such as EcoCyc integrates the evolving understanding of the genes, proteins, metabolic network and regulatory network of an organism. This article provides an overview of Pathway Tools capabilities. The software performs multiple computational inferences including prediction of metabolic pathways, prediction of metabolic pathway hole fillers and prediction of operons. It enables interactive editing of PGDBs by DB curators. It supports web publishing of PGDBs, and provides a large number of query and visualization tools. The software also supports comparative analyses of PGDBs, and provides several systems biology analyses of PGDBs including reachability analysis of metabolic networks, and interactive tracing of metabolites through a metabolic network. More than 800 PGDBs have been created using Pathway Tools by scientists around the world, many of which are curated DBs for important model organisms. Those PGDBs can be exchanged using a peer-to-peer DB sharing system called the PGDB Registry.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>von Mering, Christian</author><author>Jensen, Lars J</author><author>Snel, Berend</author><author>Hooper, Sean D</author><author>Krupp, Markus</author><author>Foglierini, Mathilde</author><author>Jouffre, Nelly</author><author>Huynen, Martijn A</author><author>Bork, Peer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>STRING: known and predicted protein-protein associations, integrated and transferred across organisms.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D433-7</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>Database issue</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><isbn>1362-4962; 0305-1048</isbn><accession-num>15608232</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gki005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2005 - von Mering et al. - Nucleic acids research - STRING known and predicted protein-protein associations, integrated and transferred.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://string.</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15608232</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC539959</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A full description of a protein's function requires knowledge of all partner proteins with which it specifically associates. From a functional perspective, 'association' can mean direct physical binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process. Currently, information about protein association is scattered over a wide variety of resources and model organisms. STRING aims to simplify access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled collection of protein-protein associations for a large number of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature, and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. STRING integrates and ranks these associations by benchmarking them against a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described, by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms, where applicable. STRING currently holds 730,000 proteins in 180 fully sequenced organisms, and is available at http://string.embl.de/.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schaefer, Carl F</author><author>Anthony, Kira</author><author>Krupa, Shiva</author><author>Buchoff, Jeffrey</author><author>Day, Matthew</author><author>Hannay, Timo</author><author>Buetow, Kenneth H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PID: the Pathway Interaction Database.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D674-9</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>Database issue</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>1362-4962 (Electronic)\n0305-1048 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>18832364</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkn653</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2009 - Schaefer et al. - Nucleic acids research - PID the Pathway Interaction Database.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://watermark.silverchair.com/gkn653.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAaswggGnBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGYMIIBlAIBADCCAY0GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMtDSulZLR15snDur5AgEQgIIBXuKtnSHhftF88h3PjSNdoJLasJv-CemSxqUgBhzygx8E2W6t</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Pathway Interaction Database (PID, http://pid.nci.nih.gov) is a freely available collection of curated and peer-reviewed pathways composed of human molecular signaling and regulatory events and key cellular processes. Created in a collaboration between the US National Cancer Institute and Nature Publishing Group, the database serves as a research tool for the cancer research community and others interested in cellular pathways, such as neuroscientists, developmental biologists and immunologists. PID offers a range of search features to facilitate pathway exploration. Users can browse the predefined set of pathways or create interaction network maps centered on a single molecule or cellular process of interest. In addition, the batch query tool allows users to upload long list(s) of molecules, such as those derived from microarray experiments, and either overlay these molecules onto predefined pathways or visualize the complete molecular connectivity map. Users can also download molecule lists, citation lists and complete database content in extensible markup language (XML) and Biological Pathways Exchange (BioPAX) Level 2 format. The database is updated with new pathway content every month and supplemented by specially commissioned articles on the practical uses of other relevant online tools.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krasteva, Petya V</author><author>Fong, Jiunn C N</author><author>Shikuma, Nicholas J</author><author>Beyhan, Sinem</author><author>Navarro, Marcos V A S</author><author>Yildiz, Fitnat H</author><author>Sondermann, Holger</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vibrio cholerae VpsT regulates matrix production and motility by directly sensing cyclic di-GMP.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>866-8</pages><volume>327</volume><issue>5967</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>3143627344</isbn><accession-num>20150502</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1181185</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Krasteva et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Vibrio cholerae VpsT regulates matrix production and motility by directly sensing cy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21959306</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3259195</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20150502</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2828054</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Microorganisms can switch from a planktonic, free-swimming life-style to a sessile, colonial state, called a biofilm, which confers resistance to environmental stress. Conversion between the motile and biofilm life-styles has been attributed to increased levels of the prokaryotic second messenger cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), yet the signaling mechanisms mediating such a global switch are poorly understood. Here we show that the transcriptional regulator VpsT from Vibrio cholerae directly senses c-di-GMP to inversely control extracellular matrix production and motility, which identifies VpsT as a master regulator for biofilm formation. Rather than being regulated by phosphorylation, VpsT undergoes a change in oligomerization on c-di-GMP binding.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gehler, Scott</author><author>Ponik, Suzanne M</author><author>Riching, Kristin M</author><author>Keely, Patricia J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bi-Directional Signaling: Extracellular Matrix and Integrin Regulation of Breast Tumor Progression</title><secondary-title>Critical Reviews in Eukaryotic Gene Expression</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Critical Reviews in Eukaryotic Gene Expression</full-title></periodical><pages>139-157</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>FAK</keyword><keyword>Mechanotransduction</keyword><keyword>RhoA</keyword><keyword>bi-directional signaling</keyword><keyword>extracellular matrix</keyword><keyword>integrins</keyword><keyword>invasion</keyword><keyword>ma-trix remodeling</keyword><keyword>mechanosensor</keyword><keyword>morphogenesis</keyword><keyword>tumor progression</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1045-4403</isbn><accession-num>23582036</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1615/CritRevEukarGeneExpr.2013006647</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2013 - Gehler et al. - Critical Reviews in Eukaryotic Gene Expression - Bi-Directional Signaling Extracellular Matrix and Integrin Regul.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.dl.begellhouse.com/download/article/4a2bd9b75c759ed9/CRE_6647_Gehler_F.pdf</url><url>http://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/6dbf508d3b17c437,64d945aa34349b2b,4a2bd9b75c759ed9.html</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cell transformation and tumor progression involve a common set of acquired capabilities, including increased proliferation, failure of cell death, self-sufficiency in growth, angiogenesis, and tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The stromal environment consists of many cell types and various extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that support normal tissue maintenance and which have been implicated in tumor progression. Both the chemical and mechanical properties of the ECM have been shown to influence normal and malignant cell behavior. For instance, mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into specific lineages that are dependent on matrix stiffness, while tumor cells undergo changes in cell behavior and gene expression in response to matrix stiffness. ECM remodeling is implicated in tumor progression and can result in increased deposition of stromal ECM, enhanced contraction of ECM fibrils, and altered collagen alignment and ECM stiffness. Tumor cells respond to changes in ECM remodeling through altered intracellular signaling and cell cycle control that lead to enhanced proliferation, loss of normal tissue architecture, and local tumor cell migration and invasion. This review focuses on the bi-directional interplay between the mechanical properties of the ECM and integrin-mediated signal transduction events in an effort to elucidate cell behaviors during tumor progression.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gordonov, Simon</author><author>Hwang, Mun Kyung</author><author>Wells, Alan</author><author>Gertler, Frank B</author><author>Lauffenburger, Douglas A</author><author>Bathe, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time series modeling of live-cell shape dynamics for image-based phenotypic profiling.</title><secondary-title>Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro</full-title></periodical><pages>73-90</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>0000000000000</isbn><accession-num>26658688</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c5ib00283d</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Gordonov et al. - Integrative biology quantitative biosciences from nano to macro - Time series modeling of live-cell shape dyna.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2016/ib/c5ib00283d</url><url>http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C5IB00283D</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658688</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5058786</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Live-cell imaging can be used to capture spatio-temporal aspects of cellular responses that are not accessible to fixed-cell imaging. As the use of live-cell imaging continues to increase, new computational procedures are needed to characterize and classify the temporal dynamics of individual cells. For this purpose, here we present the general experimental-computational framework SAPHIRE (Stochastic Annotation of Phenotypic Individual-cell Responses) to characterize phenotypic cellular responses from time series imaging datasets. Hidden Markov modeling is used to infer and annotate morphological state and state-switching properties from image-derived cell shape measurements. Time series modeling is performed on each cell individually, making the approach broadly useful for analyzing asynchronous cell populations. Two-color fluorescent cells simultaneously expressing actin and nuclear reporters enabled us to profile temporal changes in cell shape following pharmacological inhibition of cytoskeleton-regulatory signaling pathways. Results are compared with existing approaches conventionally applied to fixed-cell imaging datasets, and indicate that time series modeling captures heterogeneous dynamic cellular responses that can improve drug classification and offer additional important insight into mechanisms of drug action.

Rather, assembly must proceed in the context of large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks that are characterized both by conflict and combinatorial complexity. Conflict refers to the fact that protein interfaces can often bind many different partners in a mutually exclusive way, while combinatorial complexity refers to the explosion in the number of distinct complexes that can be formed by a network of binding possibilities. Using computational models, we explore the consequences of these characteristics for the global dynamics of a PPI network based on highly curated yeast two-hybrid data. The limited molecular context represented in this data-type translates formally into an assumption of independent binding sites for each protein. The challenge of avoiding the explicit enumeration of the astronomically many possibilities for complex formation is met by a rule-based approach to kinetic modeling. Despite imposing global biophysical constraints, we find that initially identical simulations rapidly diverge in the space of molecular possibilities, eventually sampling disjoint sets of large complexes. We refer to this phenomenon as &quot;compositional drift&quot;. Since interaction data in PPI networks lack detailed information about geometric and biological constraints, our study does not represent a quantitative description of cellular dynamics. Rather, our work brings to light a fundamental problem (the control of compositional drift) that must be solved by mechanisms of assembly in the context of large networks. In cases where drift is not (or cannot be) completely controlled by the cell, this phenomenon could constitute a novel source of phenotypic heterogeneity in cell populations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danos, Vincent</author><author>Feret, Jérôme</author><author>Fontana, Walter</author><author>Harmer, Russell</author><author>Hayman, Jonathan</author><author>Krivine, Jean</author><author>Thompson-Walsh, Chris</author><author>Winskel, Glynn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Graphs, Rewriting and Pathway Reconstruction for Rule-Based Models</title><secondary-title>FSTTCS 2012 - IARCS Annual Conference on Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FSTTCS 2012 - IARCS Annual Conference on Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>276-288</pages><volume>18</volume><keywords><keyword>causality</keyword><keyword>concurrency</keyword><keyword>graph rewriting</keyword><keyword>pathways</keyword><keyword>rule-based models</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>9783939897477</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4230/LIPIcs.FSTTCS.2012.276</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2012 - Danos et al. - FSTTCS 2012 - IARCS Annual Conference on Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science - Gra.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://fontana.hms.harvard.edu/sites/fontana.hms.harvard.edu/files/documents/fsttcs12.pdf</url><url>http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00809065</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this paper, we introduce a novel way of constructing concise causal histories (pathways) to represent how specified structures are formed during simulation of systems represented by rule- based models. This is founded on a new, clean, graph-based semantics introduced in the first part of this paper for Kappa, a rule-based modelling language that has emerged as a natural description of protein-protein interactions in molecular biology [1]. The semantics is capable of capturing the whole of Kappa, including subtle side-effects on deletion of structure, and its structured presentation provides the basis for the translation of techniques to other models. In particular, we give a notion of trajectory compression, which restricts a trace culminating in the production of a given structure to the actions necessary for the structure to occur. This is central to the reconstruction of biochemical pathways due to the failure of traditional techniques to provide adequately concise causal histories, and we expect it to be applicable in a range of other modelling situations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cristescu, Ioana</author><author>Fontana, Walter</author><author>Krivine, Jean</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interactions between causal structures in graph rewriting systems</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - Cristescu, Fontana, Krivine - Unknown - Interactions between causal structures in graph rewriting systems.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://fontana.hms.harvard.edu/sites/fontana.hms.harvard.edu/files/documents/story_interaction.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Graph rewrite formalisms are a powerful approach to model-ing complex molecular systems. They capture the intrinsic concurrency of molecular interactions, thereby enable a formal notion of mechanism (a partially ordered set of events) that explains how a system achieves a particular outcome given a set of rewrite rules. It is then useful to verify whether the mechanisms that emerge from a given model comply with empirical observations about their mutual interference. In this work, our objective is to determine whether a specific event in the mechanism for achieving X prevents or promotes the occurrence of a specific event in the mechanism for achieving Y. Such checks might also be used to hy-pothesize rules that would bring model mechanisms in compliance with observations. We define a rigorous framework for defining the concept of interference (positive or negative) between mechanisms induced by a system of graph-rewrite rules and for establishing whether an asserted influence can be realized given two mechanisms as an input.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forbes, Angus G</author><author>Burks, Andrew</author><author>Lee, Kristine</author><author>Li, Xing</author><author>Boutillier, Pierre</author><author>Krivine, Jean</author><author>Fontana, Walter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic Influence Networks for Rule-Based Models</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</full-title></periodical><pages>184-194</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Dynamic networks</keyword><keyword>biological data visualization</keyword><keyword>protein-protein interaction networks</keyword><keyword>rule-based modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1077-2626 VO - PP</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745280</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Forbes et al. - IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics - Dynamic Influence Networks for Rule-Based Models.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We introduce the Dynamic Influence Network (DIN), a novel visual analytics technique for representing and analyzing rule-based models of protein-protein interaction networks. Rule-based modeling has proved instrumental in developing biological models that are concise, comprehensible, easily extensible, and that mitigate the combinatorial complexity of multi-state and multi-component biological molecules. Our technique visualizes the dynamics of these rules as they evolve over time. Using the data produced by KaSim, an open source stochastic simulator of rule-based models written in the Kappa language, DINs provide a node-link diagram that represents the influence that each rule has on the other rules. That is, rather than representing individual biological components or types, we instead represent the rules about them (as nodes) and the current influence of these rules (as links). Using our interactive DIN-Viz software tool, researchers are able to query this dynamic network to find meaningful patterns about biological processes, and to identify salient aspects of complex rule-based models. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we investigate a simulation of a circadian clock model that illustrates the oscillatory behavior of the KaiC protein phosphorylation cycle.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boutillier, Pierre</author><author>Maasha, Mutaamba</author><author>Li, Xing</author><author>Medina-Abarca, Hector</author><author>Krivine, Jean</author><author>Feret, Jérôme</author><author>Cristescu, Ioana</author><author>Forbes, Angus G</author><author>Fontana, Walter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Kappa platform for rule-based modeling</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-7</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28383656</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/xxxxxx</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Boutillier et al. - Bioinformatics - The Kappa platform for rule-based modeling.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://fontana.hms.harvard.edu/sites/fontana.hms.harvard.edu/files/documents/kappa_platform.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation A significant focus of biological research is to understand the development, organization and function of tissues. A particularly productive area of study is on single layer epithelial tissues in which the adherence junctions of cells form a 2D manifold that is fluorescently labeled. Given the size of the tissue, a microscope must collect a mosaic of overlapping 3D stacks encompassing the stained surface. Downstream interpretation is greatly simplified by preprocessing such a dataset as follows: (a) extracting and mapping the stained manifold in each stack into a single 2D projection plane, (b) correcting uneven illumination artifacts, (c) stitching the mosaic planes into a single, large 2D image, and (d) adjusting the contrast. Results We have developed PreMosa, an efficient, fully automatic pipeline to perform the four preprocessing tasks above resulting in a single 2D image of the stained manifold across which contrast is optimized and illumination is even. Notable features are as follows. First, the 2D projection step employs a specially developed algorithm that actually finds the manifold in the stack based on maximizing contrast, intensity and smoothness. Second, the projection step comes first, implying all subsequent tasks are more rapidly solved in 2D. And last, the mosaic melding employs an algorithm that globally adjusts contrasts amongst the 2D tiles so as to produce a seamless, high-contrast image. We conclude with an evaluation using ground-truth datasets and present results on datasets from Drosophila melanogaster wings and Schmidtae mediterranea ciliary components.

However, compared with intracellular signal transduction networks, the function and engineering principles of cell-to-cell communication networks are far less understood. Major complications include: cells are themselves regulated by complex intracellular signaling networks; individual cells are heterogeneous; and output of any one cell can recursively become an additional input signal to other cells. Here, we make use of a framework that treats intracellular signal transduction networks as &quot;black boxes&quot; with characterized input-to-output response relationships. We study simple cell-to-cell communication circuit motifs and find conditions that generate bimodal responses in time, as well as mechanisms for independently controlling synchronization and delay of cell-population responses. We apply our modeling approach to explain otherwise puzzling data on cytokine secretion onset times in T cells. Our approach can be used to predict communication network structure using experimentally accessible input-to-output measurements and without detailed knowledge of intermediate steps.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reznik, Ed</author><author>Luna, Augustin</author><author>Aksoy, Bülent Arman</author><author>Liu, Eric Minwei</author><author>La, Konnor</author><author>Ostrovnaya, Irina</author><author>Creighton, Chad J</author><author>Hakimi, A Ari</author><author>Sander, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Landscape of Metabolic Variation across Tumor Types.</title><secondary-title>Cell systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell systems</full-title></periodical><pages>301-313.e3</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>cancer metabolism</keyword><keyword>clinical data</keyword><keyword>genomics</keyword><keyword>meta-analysis</keyword><keyword>metabolomics</keyword><keyword>tumor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29396322</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cels.2017.12.014</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Reznik et al. - Cell systems - A Landscape of Metabolic Variation across Tumor Types.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29396322</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5876114</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Tumor metabolism is reorganized to support proliferation in the face of growth-related stress. Unlike the widespread profiling of changes to metabolic enzyme levels in cancer, comparatively less attention has been paid to the substrates/products of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, small-molecule metabolites. We developed an informatic pipeline to concurrently analyze metabolomics data from over 900 tissue samples spanning seven cancer types, revealing extensive heterogeneity in metabolic changes relative to normal tissue across cancers of different tissues of origin. Despite this heterogeneity, a number of metabolites were recurrently differentially abundant across many cancers, such as lactate and acyl-carnitine species. Through joint analysis of metabolomic data alongside clinical features of patient samples, we also identified a small number of metabolites, including several polyamines and kynurenine, which were associated with aggressive tumors across several tumor types. Our findings offer a glimpse onto common patterns of metabolic reprogramming across cancers, and the work serves as a large-scale resource accessible via a web application (http://www.sanderlab.org/pancanmet).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barberis, Matteo</author><author>Verbruggen, Paul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitative Systems Biology to decipher design principles of a dynamic cell cycle network: the &quot;Maximum Allowable mammalian Trade-Off-Weight&quot; (MAmTOW).</title><secondary-title>NPJ systems biology and applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NPJ systems biology and applications</full-title></periodical><pages>26</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Molecular engineering</keyword><keyword>Systems biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>28944079</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41540-017-0028-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Barberis, Verbruggen - NPJ systems biology and applications - Quantitative Systems Biology to decipher design principles of a dyn.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-017-0028-x</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28944079</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5605530</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Network complexity is required to lend cellular processes flexibility to respond timely to a variety of dynamic signals, while simultaneously warranting robustness to protect cellular integrity against perturbations. The cell cycle serves as a paradigm for such processes; it maintains its frequency and temporal structure (although these may differ among cell types) under the former, but accelerates under the latter. Cell cycle molecules act together in time and in different cellular compartments to execute cell type-specific programs. Strikingly, the timing at which molecular switches occur is controlled by abundance and stoichiometry of multiple proteins within complexes. However, traditional methods that investigate one effector at a time are insufficient to understand how modulation of protein complex dynamics at cell cycle transitions shapes responsiveness, yet preserving robustness. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to gain a systems-level understanding of quantitative cell cycle dynamics in mammalian cells from a new perspective. By suggesting advanced experimental technologies and dedicated modeling approaches, we present innovative strategies (i) to measure absolute protein concentration in vivo, and (ii) to determine how protein dosage, e.g., altered protein abundance, and spatial (de)regulation may affect timing and robustness of phase transitions. We describe a method that we name &quot;Maximum Allowable mammalian Trade-Off-Weight&quot; (MAmTOW), which may be realized to determine the upper limit of gene copy numbers in mammalian cells. These aspects, not covered by current systems biology approaches, are essential requirements to generate precise computational models and identify (sub)network-centered nodes underlying a plethora of pathological conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hass, Helge</author><author>Masson, Kristina</author><author>Wohlgemuth, Sibylle</author><author>Paragas, Violette</author><author>Allen, John E.</author><author>Sevecka, Mark</author><author>Pace, Emily</author><author>Timmer, Jens</author><author>Stelling, Joerg</author><author>MacBeath, Gavin</author><author>Schoeberl, Birgit</author><author>Raue, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting ligand-dependent tumors from multi-dimensional signaling features.</title><secondary-title>NPJ systems biology and applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NPJ systems biology and applications</full-title></periodical><pages>27</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Biochemical networks</keyword><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Computer modelling</keyword><keyword>Dynamical systems</keyword><keyword>Virtual drug screening</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><isbn>2056-7189</isbn><accession-num>28944080</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41540-017-0030-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Hass et al. - NPJ systems biology and applications - Predicting ligand-dependent tumors from multi-dimensional signaling features.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-017-0030-3</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28944080</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5607260</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Targeted therapies have shown significant patient benefit in about 5-10% of solid tumors that are addicted to a single oncogene. Here, we explore the idea of ligand addiction as a driver of tumor growth. High ligand levels in tumors have been shown to be associated with impaired patient survival, but targeted therapies have not yet shown great benefit in unselected patient populations. Using an approach of applying Bagged Decision Trees (BDT) to high-dimensional signaling features derived from a computational model, we can predict ligand dependent proliferation across a set of 58 cell lines. This mechanistic, multi-pathway model that features receptor heterodimerization, was trained on seven cancer cell lines and can predict signaling across two independent cell lines by adjusting only the receptor expression levels for each cell line. Interestingly, for patient samples the predicted tumor growth response correlates with high growth factor expression in the tumor microenvironment, which argues for a co-evolution of both factors in vivo.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nyman, Elin</author><author>Bartesaghi, Stefano</author><author>Melin Rydfalk, Rebecka</author><author>Eng, Sandra</author><author>Pollard, Charlotte</author><author>Gennemark, Peter</author><author>Peng, Xiao-Rong</author><author>Cedersund, Gunnar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systems biology reveals uncoupling beyond UCP1 in human white fat-derived beige adipocytes.</title><secondary-title>NPJ systems biology and applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NPJ systems biology and applications</full-title></periodical><pages>29</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Bioenergetics</keyword><keyword>Cell biology</keyword><keyword>Computational biology and bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Computer modelling</keyword><keyword>Medical research</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>28983409</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41540-017-0027-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Nyman et al. - NPJ systems biology and applications - Systems biology reveals uncoupling beyond UCP1 in human white fat-derived b.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-017-0027-y</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28983409</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5626775</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Pharmaceutical induction of metabolically active beige adipocytes in the normally energy storing white adipose tissue has potential to reduce obesity. Mitochondrial uncoupling in beige adipocytes, as in brown adipocytes, has been reported to occur via the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). However, several previous in vitro characterizations of human beige adipocytes have only measured UCP1 mRNA fold increase, and assumed a direct correlation with metabolic activity. Here, we provide an example of pharmaceutical induction of beige adipocytes, where increased mRNA levels of UCP1 are not translated into increased protein levels, and perform a thorough analysis of this example. We incorporate mRNA and protein levels of UCP1, time-resolved mitochondrial characterizations, and numerous perturbations, and analyze all data with a new fit-for-purpose mathematical model. The systematic analysis challenges the seemingly obvious experimental conclusion, i.e., that UCP1 is not active in the induced cells, and shows that hypothesis testing with iterative modeling and experimental work is needed to sort out the role of UCP1. The analyses demonstrate, for the first time, that the uncoupling capability of human beige adipocytes can be obtained without UCP1 activity. This finding thus opens the door to a new direction in drug discovery that targets obesity and its associated comorbidities. Furthermore, the analysis advances our understanding of how to evaluate UCP1-independent thermogenesis in human beige adipocytes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weddell, Jared C.</author><author>Chen, Si</author><author>Imoukhuede, P.

Despite this promise, VEGF-targeted therapies are not clinically effective for many pathologies, such as breast cancer. VEGFR1 has recently emerged as a predictive biomarker for anti-VEGF efficacy, implying a functional VEGFR1 role beyond its classically defined decoy receptor status. Here we introduce a computational approach that accurately predicts cellular responses elicited via VEGFR1 signaling. Aligned with our model prediction, we show empirically that VEGFR1 promotes macrophage migration through PLCγ and PI3K pathways and promotes macrophage proliferation through a PLCγ pathway.

Moreover, many gene signatures rarely come out as significant in statistical tests. Based on pan-cancer data analysis, we construct a restricted set of 962 signatures defined as informative and demonstrate that they have a higher probability to appear enriched in comparative cancer studies. We show that the majority of informative signatures conserve their weights for the genes composing the signature (eigengenes) from one cancer type to another. We finally construct InfoSigMap, an interactive online map of these signatures and their cross-correlations. This map highlights the structure of compositional and functional redundancies between informative signatures, and it charts the territories of biological functions. InfoSigMap can be used to visualize the results of omics data analyses and suggests a rearrangement of existing gene sets.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Quarton, Tyler</author><author>Ehrhardt, Kristina</author><author>Lee, James</author><author>Kannan, Srijaa</author><author>Li, Yi</author><author>Ma, Lan</author><author>Bleris, Leonidas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping the operational landscape of microRNAs in synthetic gene circuits.</title><secondary-title>NPJ systems biology and applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NPJ systems biology and applications</full-title></periodical><pages>6</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Genetic circuit engineering</keyword><keyword>Synthetic biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>29354284</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41540-017-0043-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Quarton et al. - NPJ systems biology and applications - Mapping the operational landscape of microRNAs in synthetic gene circuits.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-017-0043-y</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29354284</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5765153</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>MicroRNAs are a class of short, noncoding RNAs that are ubiquitous modulators of gene expression, with roles in development, homeostasis, and disease. Engineered microRNAs are now frequently used as regulatory modules in synthetic biology. Moreover, synthetic gene circuits equipped with engineered microRNA targets with perfect complementarity to endogenous microRNAs establish an interface with the endogenous milieu at the single-cell level. The function of engineered microRNAs and sensor systems is typically optimized through extensive trial-and-error. Here, using a combination of synthetic biology experimentation in human embryonic kidney cells and quantitative analysis, we investigate the relationship between input genetic template abundance, microRNA concentration, and output under microRNA control. We provide a framework that employs the complete operational landscape of a synthetic gene circuit and enables the stepwise development of mathematical models. We derive a phenomenological model that recapitulates experimentally observed nonlinearities and contains features that provide insight into the microRNA function at various abundances. Our work facilitates the characterization and engineering of multi-component genetic circuits and specifically points to new insights on the operation of microRNAs as mediators of endogenous information and regulators of gene expression in synthetic biology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lahini, Yoav</author><author>Steinbrecher, Gregory R</author><author>Bookatz, Adam D</author><author>Englund, Dirk</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantum logic using correlated one-dimensional quantum walks</title><secondary-title>npj Quantum Information</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>npj Quantum Information</full-title></periodical><pages>2</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41534-017-0050-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Lahini et al. - npj Quantum Information - Quantum logic using correlated one-dimensional quantum walks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-017-0050-2.pdf</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-017-0050-2</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Quantum Walks are unitary processes describing the evolution of an initially localized wavefunction on a lattice potential. The complexity of the dynamics increases significantly when several indistinguishable quantum walkers propagate on the same lattice simultaneously, as these develop non-trivial spatial correlations that depend on the particle’s quantum statistics, mutual interactions, initial positions, and the lattice potential. We show that even in the simplest case of a quantum walk on a one dimensional graph, these correlations can be shaped to yield a complete set of compact quantum logic operations. We provide detailed recipes for implementing quantum logic on one-dimensional quantum walks in two general cases. For non-interacting bosons—such as photons in waveguide lattices—we find high-fidelity probabilistic quantum gates that could be integrated into linear optics quantum computation schemes. For interacting quantum-walkers on a one-dimensional lattice—a situation that has recently been demonstrated using ultra-cold atoms—we find deterministic logic operations that are universal for quantum information processing. The suggested implementation requires minimal resources and a level of control that is within reach using recently demonstrated techniques. Further work is required to address error-correction.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bozzio, Mathieu</author><author>Orieux, Adeline</author><author>Vidarte, Luis Trigo</author><author>Zaquine, Isabelle</author><author>Kerenidis, Iordanis</author><author>Diamanti, Eleni</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Experimental investigation of practical unforgeable quantum money</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41534-018-0058-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Bozzio et al. - Unknown - Experimental investigation of practical unforgeable quantum money.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0058-2.pdf</url><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01428%0Ahttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41534-018-0058-2</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Wiesner's unforgeable quantum money scheme is widely celebrated as the first quantum information application. Based on the no-cloning property of quantum mechanics, this scheme allows for the creation of credit cards used in authenticated transactions offering security guarantees impossible to achieve by classical means. However, despite its central role in quantum cryptography, its experimental implementation has remained elusive because of the lack of quantum memories and of practical verification techniques. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum money protocol relying on classical verification that rigorously satisfies the security condition for unforgeability. Our system exploits polarization encoding of weak coherent states of light and operates under conditions that ensure compatibility with state-of-the-art quantum memories. We derive working regimes for our system using a security analysis taking into account all practical imperfections. Our results constitute a major step towards a real-world realization of this milestone protocol.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Richard Y</author><author>Di Felice, Rosa</author><author>Rohs, Remo</author><author>Lidar, Daniel A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantum annealing versus classical machine learning applied to a simplified computational biology problem</title><secondary-title>npj Quantum Information</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>npj Quantum Information</full-title></periodical><pages>14</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41534-018-0060-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Li et al. - npj Quantum Information - Quantum annealing versus classical machine learning applied to a simplified computational b.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0060-8.pdf</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0060-8</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Transcription factors regulate gene expression, but how these proteins recognize and specifically bind to their DNA targets is still debated. Machine learning models are effective means to reveal interaction mechanisms. Here we studied the ability of a quantum machine learning approach to classify and rank binding affinities. Using simplified data sets of a small number of DNA sequences derived from actual binding affinity experiments, we trained a commercially available quantum annealer to classify and rank transcription factor binding. The results were compared to state-of-the-art classical approaches for the same simplified data sets, including simulated annealing, simulated quantum annealing, multiple linear regression, LASSO, and extreme gradient boosting. Despite technological limitations, we find a slight advantage in classification performance and nearly equal ranking performance using the quantum annealer for these fairly small training data sets. Thus, we propose that quantum annealing might be an effective method to implement machine learning for certain computational biology problems.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Elliott, Thomas J</author><author>Gu, Mile</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Superior memory efficiency of quantum devices for the simulation of continuous-time stochastic processes</title><secondary-title>npj Quantum Information</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>npj Quantum Information</full-title></periodical><pages>18</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41534-018-0064-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Elliott, Gu - npj Quantum Information - Superior memory efficiency of quantum devices for the simulation of continuous-time stoch.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0064-4.pdf</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0064-4</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Continuous-time stochastic processes pervade everyday experience, and the simulation of models of these processes is of great utility. Classical models of systems operating in continuous-time must typically track an unbounded amount of information about past behaviour, even for relatively simple models, enforcing limits on precision due to the finite memory of the machine. However, quantum machines can require less information about the past than even their optimal classical counterparts to simulate the future of discrete-time processes, and we demonstrate that this advantage extends to the continuous-time regime. Moreover, we show that this reduction in the memory requirement can be unboundedly large, allowing for arbitrary precision even with a finite quantum memory. We provide a systematic method for finding superior quantum constructions, and a protocol for analogue simulation of continuous-time renewal processes with a quantum machine. npj Quantum Information (2018) 4:18 ; doi:10.1038/s41534-018-0064-4 INTRODUCTION Our experience of the world manifests as a series of observations. The goal of science is to provide a consistent explanation for these, and further, make predictions about future observations. That is, science aims to provide a model of Nature, to describe the processes that give rise to the observations. It is possible to devise many different models that make identical predictions, and so it is desirable to have criteria that discern the 'best' model. One such guiding philosophy is Occam's razor &quot; plurality should not be posited without necessity &quot; , which can be interpreted as requiring that a model should be the 'simplest' that accurately describes our observations. This now leaves us with the question of how to determine the simplest model. The field of computational mechanics 1–3 seeks to answer this, defining the optimal predictive model of a process to be that which requires the least information about the past in order to predict the future, and uses this minimal memory requirement as a measure of complexity. There is motivation for preferring simpler models beyond the inclination for elegance; it allows one to make more fundamental statements about the processes themselves, due to their irreducible nature. 3 More pragmatically, it also facilitates the building of simulators (devices emulating the behaviour of the system (Fig. 1)) 4 for the process, as simpler models require fewer resources (here, internal memory). Discrete-time processes have been well-studied within the computational mechanics framework. 5–16 However, it has recently been shown that quantum machines can be constructed that in general exhibit a lower complexity, and hence a lower memory requirement, than their optimal classical counterparts. 17–24 This substantiates the perhaps surprising notion that a quantum device can be more efficient than a classical system, even for the simulation of a purely classical stochastic process. This has recently been verified experimentally. 25</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Tiankai</author><author>Zhang, Yao</author><author>Wei, Qiong</author><author>Shi, Xuechen</author><author>Zhao, Peng</author><author>Chen, Long-Qing</author><author>Zhang, Sulin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Active cell-matrix coupling regulates cellular force landscapes of cohesive epithelial monolayers</title><secondary-title>npj Computational Materials</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>npj Computational Materials</full-title></periodical><pages>10</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41524-018-0069-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Zhao et al. - npj Computational Materials - Active cell-matrix coupling regulates cellular force landscapes of cohesive epithelia.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-018-0069-8.pdf</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-018-0069-8</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Epithelial cells can assemble into cohesive monolayers with rich morphologies on substrates due to competition between elastic, edge, and interfacial effects.

In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vrabioiu, Alina M.</author><author>Struhl, Gary</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fat/Dachsous Signaling Promotes Drosophila Wing Growth by Regulating the Conformational State of the NDR Kinase Warts</title><secondary-title>Developmental Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Developmental Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>737-749</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><isbn>doi:10.1016/j.devcel.2015.11.027</isbn><accession-num>26702832</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.devcel.2015.11.027</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Vrabioiu, Struhl - Developmental Cell - FatDachsous Signaling Promotes Drosophila Wing Growth by Regulating the Conformational St.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2015.11.027</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) kinases play a central role in limiting growth in most animals. Signals that promote growth do so in part by suppressing the activation of NDR kinases by STE20/Hippo kinases. Here, we identify another mechanism for downregulating NDR kinase activity. Specifically, we show that activity of the Drosophila NDR kinase Warts in the developing wing depends on its transition from an inactive, &quot;closed&quot; conformation to a potentially active, &quot;open&quot; conformation mediated by Mats, a conserved Mps1-binder (Mob) protein. Further, we show that signaling interactions between the protocadherins Fat and Dachsous, organized by the morphogens Wingless and Decapentaplegic, suppress Warts by acting via the atypical myosin Dachs to inhibit or reverse this transition. The regulation of Warts conformation by Mats, Fat/Dachsous signaling, and Dachs appears independent of Warts phosphorylation by Hippo kinase, establishing a precedent for the control of NDR kinases, and hence growth, by distinct allosteric and phosphorylation mechanisms.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wyant, Gregory A.</author><author>Abu-Remaileh, Monther</author><author>Wolfson, Rachel L.</author><author>Chen, Walter W.</author><author>Freinkman, Elizaveta</author><author>Danai, Laura V.</author><author>Vander Heiden, Matthew G.</author><author>Sabatini, David M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>mTORC1 Activator SLC38A9 Is Required to Efflux Essential Amino Acids from Lysosomes and Use Protein as a Nutrient</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>642-654.e12</pages><volume>171</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>amino acid sensing</keyword><keyword>autophagy</keyword><keyword>lysosome</keyword><keyword>mTOR</keyword><keyword>micropinocytosis</keyword><keyword>nutrient sensing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>29053970</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2017.09.046</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Wyant et al. - Cell - mTORC1 Activator SLC38A9 Is Required to Efflux Essential Amino Acids from Lysosomes and Use Protein as a Nu.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.09.046</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The mTORC1 kinase is a master growth regulator that senses many environmental cues, including amino acids. Activation of mTORC1 by arginine requires SLC38A9, a poorly understood lysosomal membrane protein with homology to amino acid transporters. Here, we validate that SLC38A9 is an arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway, and we uncover an unexpectedly central role for SLC38A9 in amino acid homeostasis. SLC38A9 mediates the transport, in an arginine-regulated fashion, of many essential amino acids out of lysosomes, including leucine, which mTORC1 senses through the cytosolic Sestrin proteins. SLC38A9 is necessary for leucine generated via lysosomal proteolysis to exit lysosomes and activate mTORC1. Pancreatic cancer cells, which use macropinocytosed protein as a nutrient source, require SLC38A9 to form tumors. Thus, through SLC38A9, arginine serves as a lysosomal messenger that couples mTORC1 activation to the release from lysosomes of the essential amino acids needed to drive cell growth. SLC38A9 is an arginine-regulated transporter of major amino acids, including leucine, providing insights into the regulation of the mTORC pathway and its nutrient-sensing function.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martinez-Martin, Pablo</author><author>Reddy, Prashanth</author><author>Antonini, Angelo</author><author>Henriksen, Tove</author><author>Katzenschlager, Regina</author><author>Odin, Per</author><author>Todorova, Antonia</author><author>Naidu, Yogini</author><author>Tluk, Susanne</author><author>Chandiramani, Chandni</author><author>Martin, Anne</author><author>Chaudhuri, Kallol Ray</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chronic subcutaneous infusion therapy with apomorphine in advanced Parkinson's disease compared to conventional therapy: a real life study of non motor effect.</title><secondary-title>Journal of Parkinson's disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Parkinson's disease</full-title></periodical><pages>197-203</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Condensed Matter Physics</keyword><keyword>Quantum Information</keyword><keyword>Subject Areas</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>23934921</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3233/JPD-2011-11037</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - O’Malley et al. - Physical Review X - Scalable Quantum Simulation of Molecular Energies.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.031007</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23934921</url><url>https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.031007</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Apomorphine infusion therapy remains under-used and there are no comparative studies of motor and non-motor effects of apomorphine infusion. METHODS In this paper we report preliminary results from an ongoing clinical observational &quot;real life&quot; surveillance-based study focused on effects of this therapy on non-motor symptoms and health-related quality of life in a group of patients on apomorphine. RESULTS Apomorphine infusion led to highly significant improvements in UPDRS 3 (p = 0.0003), UPDRS 4 (p = 0.0003), PDQ-8 (Parkinson's disease questionnaire, p = 0.001) and NMSS total (non motor symptoms scale, p = 0.0003). Furthermore, apomorphine was tolerated in patients with visual hallucinations, illusions and paranoid ideations while significant improvement in specific non-motor symptoms such as hyperhidrosis, nocturia, urgency of micturition, and fatigue was recorded. Levodopa equivalent dose decreased significantly (1077.81 ± 446.26 to 458.75 ± 282.29, p &lt; 0.0001) and a large effect size of intervention was noted. In an untreated group no such improvement was noted. The number needed to treat (NNT) for improvement &gt;1 SEM in the Apo group was calculated and was lower than 2 for &gt;1 SEM improvement of UPDRS 3, NMSS, and PDQ-8 total scores. CONCLUSIONS This pilot observational study suggests that non-motor effects are evident with apomorphine therapy and patients suitable for apomorphine deteriorate in the absence of therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aspuru-Guzik, Alán</author><author>Dutoi, Anthony D</author><author>Love, Peter J</author><author>Head-Gordon, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulated quantum computation of molecular energies.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>1704-7</pages><volume>309</volume><issue>5741</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>16151006</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1113479</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2005 - Aspuru-Guzik et al. - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Simulated quantum computation of molecular energies.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16151006</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The calculation time for the energy of atoms and molecules scales exponentially with system size on a classical computer but polynomially using quantum algorithms. We demonstrate that such algorithms can be applied to problems of chemical interest using modest numbers of quantum bits. Calculations of the water and lithium hydride molecular ground-state energies have been carried out on a quantum computer simulator using a recursive phase-estimation algorithm. The recursive algorithm reduces the number of quantum bits required for the readout register from about 20 to 4. Mappings of the molecular wave function to the quantum bits are described. An adiabatic method for the preparation of a good approximate ground-state wave function is described and demonstrated for a stretched hydrogen molecule. The number of quantum bits required scales linearly with the number of basis functions, and the number of gates required grows polynomially with the number of quantum bits.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peruzzo, Alberto</author><author>McClean, Jarrod</author><author>Shadbolt, Peter</author><author>Yung, Man-Hong</author><author>Zhou, Xiao-Qi</author><author>Love, Peter J</author><author>Aspuru-Guzik, Alán</author><author>O'Brien, Jeremy L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A variational eigenvalue solver on a photonic quantum processor.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>4213</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>2041-1723 (Electronic) 2041-1723 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>25055053</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms5213</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Peruzzo et al. - Nature communications - A variational eigenvalue solver on a photonic quantum processor.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968000405000435</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11007476</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15550247</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055053</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry--calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He-H(+). The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sefik, Esen</author><author>Geva-Zatorsky, Naama</author><author>Oh, Sungwhan</author><author>Konnikova, Liza</author><author>Zemmour, David</author><author>McGuire, Abigail Manson</author><author>Burzyn, Dalia</author><author>Ortiz-Lopez, Adriana</author><author>Lobera, Mercedes</author><author>Yang, Jianfei</author><author>Ghosh, Shomir</author><author>Earl, Ashlee</author><author>Snapper, Scott B.</author><author>Jupp, Ray</author><author>Kasper, Dennis</author><author>Mathis, Diane</author><author>Benoist, Christophe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY.

We now report that symbiotic members of the human gut microbiota induce a distinct T(reg) population in the mouse colon, which constrains immuno-inflammatory responses. This induction—which we find to map to a broad, but specific, array of individual bacterial species—requires the transcription factor Rorγ, paradoxically, in that Rorγ is thought to antagonize FoxP3 and to promote T helper 17 (T(H)17) cell differentiation. Rorγ's transcriptional footprint differs in colonic T(regs) and T(H)17 cells and controls important effector molecules. Rorγ, and the T(regs) that express it, contribute substantially to regulating colonic T(H)1/T(H)17 inflammation.

Their differentiation is controlled by RORγt, a ligand-regulated nuclear receptor. Here we identify the RNA helicase DEAD-box protein 5 (DDX5) as a RORγt partner that coordinates transcription of selective TH17 genes, and is required for TH17-mediated inflammatory pathologies. Surprisingly, the ability of DDX5 to interact with RORγt and coactivate its targets depends on intrinsic RNA helicase activity and binding of a conserved nuclear long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), Rmrp, which is mutated in patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia. A targeted Rmrp gene mutation in mice, corresponding to a gene mutation in cartilage-hair hypoplasia patients, altered lncRNA chromatin occupancy, and reduced the DDX5-RORγt interaction and RORγt target gene transcription. Elucidation of the link between Rmrp and the DDX5-RORγt complex reveals a role for RNA helicases and lncRNAs in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation, and provides new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in TH17-dependent diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gagliani, Nicola</author><author>Amezcua Vesely, Maria Carolina</author><author>Iseppon, Andrea</author><author>Brockmann, Leonie</author><author>Xu, Hao</author><author>Palm, Noah W.</author><author>de Zoete, Marcel R</author><author>Licona-Limón, Paula</author><author>Paiva, Ricardo S.</author><author>Ching, Travers</author><author>Weaver, Casey</author><author>Zi, Xiaoyuan</author><author>Pan, Xinghua</author><author>Fan, Rong</author><author>Garmire, Lana X.</author><author>Cotton, Matthew J.</author><author>Drier, Yotam</author><author>Bernstein, Bradley</author><author>Geginat, Jens</author><author>Stockinger, Brigitta</author><author>Esplugues, Enric</author><author>Huber, Samuel</author><author>Flavell, Richard A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Th17 cells transdifferentiate into regulatory T cells during resolution of inflammation.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>221-5</pages><volume>523</volume><issue>7559</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0028-0836</isbn><accession-num>25924064</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature14452</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Gagliani et al. - Nature - Th17 cells transdifferentiate into regulatory T cells during resolution of inflammation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25924064</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4498984</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Inflammation is a beneficial host response to infection but can contribute to inflammatory disease if unregulated. The Th17 lineage of T helper (Th) cells can cause severe human inflammatory diseases. These cells exhibit both instability (they can cease to express their signature cytokine, IL-17A) and plasticity (they can start expressing cytokines typical of other lineages) upon in vitro re-stimulation. However, technical limitations have prevented the transcriptional profiling of pre- and post-conversion Th17 cells ex vivo during immune responses. Thus, it is unknown whether Th17 cell plasticity merely reflects change in expression of a few cytokines, or if Th17 cells physiologically undergo global genetic reprogramming driving their conversion from one T helper cell type to another, a process known as transdifferentiation. Furthermore, although Th17 cell instability/plasticity has been associated with pathogenicity, it is unknown whether this could present a therapeutic opportunity, whereby formerly pathogenic Th17 cells could adopt an anti-inflammatory fate. Here we used two new fate-mapping mouse models to track Th17 cells during immune responses to show that CD4(+) T cells that formerly expressed IL-17A go on to acquire an anti-inflammatory phenotype. The transdifferentiation of Th17 into regulatory T cells was illustrated by a change in their signature transcriptional profile and the acquisition of potent regulatory capacity. Comparisons of the transcriptional profiles of pre- and post-conversion Th17 cells also revealed a role for canonical TGF-β signalling and consequently for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in conversion. Thus, Th17 cells transdifferentiate into regulatory cells, and contribute to the resolution of inflammation. Our data suggest that Th17 cell instability and plasticity is a therapeutic opportunity for inflammatory diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weibezahn, Jimena</author><author>Tessarz, Peter</author><author>Schlieker, Christian</author><author>Zahn, Regina</author><author>Maglica, Zeljka</author><author>Lee, Sukyeong</author><author>Zentgraf, Hanswalter</author><author>Weber-Ban, Eilika U</author><author>Dougan, David A</author><author>Tsai, Francis T F</author><author>Mogk, Axel</author><author>Bukau, Bernd</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thermotolerance requires refolding of aggregated proteins by substrate translocation through the central pore of ClpB.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>653-65</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><isbn>0167-7799</isbn><accession-num>15550247</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2004.11.027</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2004 - Weibezahn et al. - Cell - Thermotolerance requires refolding of aggregated proteins by substrate translocation through the centra.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968000405000435</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11007476</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15550247</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cell survival under severe thermal stress requires the activity of the ClpB (Hsp104) AAA+ chaperone that solubilizes and reactivates aggregated proteins in concert with the DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone system. How protein disaggregation is achieved and whether survival is solely dependent on ClpB-mediated elimination of aggregates or also on reactivation of aggregated proteins has been unclear. We engineered a ClpB variant, BAP, which associates with the ClpP peptidase and thereby is converted into a degrading disaggregase. BAP translocates substrates through its central pore directly into ClpP for degradation. ClpB-dependent translocation is demonstrated to be an integral part of the disaggregation mechanism. Protein disaggregation by the BAP/ClpP complex remains dependent on DnaK, defining a role for DnaK at early stages of the disaggregation reaction. The activity switch of BAP to a degrading disaggregase does not support thermotolerance development, demonstrating that cell survival during severe thermal stress requires reactivation of aggregated proteins.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hu, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of Two Quantum Nearest Neighbor Classifiers on IBM’s Quantum Simulator</title></titles><periodical/><pages>87-98</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>0</keyword><keyword>2018</keyword><keyword>2018 accepted</keyword><keyword>2018 by author and</keyword><keyword>2018 published</keyword><keyword>Quantum Computation</keyword><keyword>Quantum Machine Learning</keyword><keyword>Quantum Nearest Neighbor Algorithm</keyword><keyword>attribution international license</keyword><keyword>cc by 4</keyword><keyword>copyright</keyword><keyword>february 12</keyword><keyword>march 12</keyword><keyword>march 9</keyword><keyword>quantum computation</keyword><keyword>quantum machine learning</keyword><keyword>quantum nearest neighbor algorithm</keyword><keyword>received</keyword><keyword>scientific research publishing inc</keyword><keyword>this work is licensed</keyword><keyword>under the creative commons</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Hu - Unknown - Comparison of Two Quantum Nearest Neighbor Classifiers on IBM’s Quantum Simulator.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Today computers are used to store data in memory and then process them. In our big data era, we are facing the challenge of storing and processing the data simply due to their fast ever growing size. Quantum computation offers solutions to these two prominent issues quantum mechanically and beautifully. Through careful design to employ superposition, entanglement, and interference of quantum states, a quantum algorithm can allow a quantum computer to store datasets of exponentially large size as linear size and then process them in parallel. Quantum computing has found its way in the world of machine learning where new ideas and approaches are in great need as the classical computers have reached their capacity and the demand for processing big data grows much faster than the computing power the classical computers can provide today. Nearest neighbor algorithms are simple, robust, and versatile supervised machine learning algorithms, which store all training data points as their learned “model” and make the prediction of a new test data point by computing the distances between the query point and all the training data points. Quantum counterparts of these classical algorithms provide efficient and elegant ways to deal with the two major issues of storing data in memory and computing the distances. The purpose of our study is to select two similar quantum nearest neighbor algorithms and use a simple dataset to give insight into how they work, highlight their quantum nature, and compare their performances on IBM’s quantum simulator.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hu, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Empirical Analysis of Decision Making of an AI Agent on IBM ’ s 5Q Quantum Computer</title></titles><periodical/><pages>45-58</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Quantum Computation, Quantum Machine Learning, Qua</keyword><keyword>quantum</keyword><keyword>quantum computation</keyword><keyword>quantum machine learning</keyword><keyword>quantum reinforcement learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4236/jqis.2018.81001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Hu - Unknown - Empirical Analysis of Decision Making of an AI Agent on IBM ’ s 5Q Quantum Computer.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>A recent work has shown that using an ion trap quantum processor can speed up the decision making of a reinforcement learning agent. Its quantum advantage is observed when the external environment changes, and then agent needs to relearn again. One character of this quantum hardware system discovered in this study is that it tends to overestimate the values used to determine the actions the agent will take. IBM’s five qubit superconducting quantum processor is a popular quantum platform. The aims of our study are twofold. First we want to identify the hardware characteristic features of IBM’s 5Q quantum computer when running this learning agent, compared with the ion trap processor. Second, through careful analysis, we observe that the quantum circuit employed in the ion trap processor for this agent could be simplified. Furthermore, when tested on IBM’s 5Q quantum processor, our simplified circuit demonstrates its enhanced performance over the original circuit on one of the hard learning tasks investigated in the previous work. We also use IBM’s quantum simulator when a good baseline is needed to compare the performances. As more and more quantum hardware devices are moving out of the laboratory and becoming generally available to public use, our work emphasizes the fact that the features and constraints of the quantum hardware could take a toll on the performance of quantum algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fedortchenko, Sergueï</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A quantum teleportation experiment for undergraduate students</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Fedortchenko - Unknown - A quantum teleportation experiment for undergraduate students.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02398</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>With the rapid progress of quantum information these recent years, it becomes more and more relevant to dedicate efforts in introducing this research topic to undergraduate students. However, as if in various fields of physics the theoretical learning is closely accompanied with experimental illustrations, such a teaching method can be expensive to organise for quantum information. We propose one way to circumvent these difficulties by using the recently made available 5-qubit quantum processor of IBM, in order to illustrate quantum information tasks, by actually implementing them on the superconducting chip through the web interface of the IBM Quantum Experience. We focus on the realization of a quantum teleportation protocol on this device, analyze the results and discuss the issues encountered, providing a complete analysis of this software as a pedagogical tool.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghosh, Debjit</author><author>Agarwal, Pratik</author><author>Pandey, Pratyush</author><author>Behera, Bikash K.</author><author>Panigrahi, Prasanta K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automated Error Correction in IBM Quantum Computer and Explicit Generalization</title></titles><periodical/><keywords><keyword>algorithm</keyword><keyword>automated error correction</keyword><keyword>ibm quantum experience</keyword><keyword>non-destructive discrimination algorithm</keyword><keyword>quantum state tomography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Ghosh et al. - Unknown - Automated Error Correction in IBM Quantum Computer and Explicit Generalization.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02297</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Experimental realization of automated error correction is demonstrated through IBM Quantum Experience for Bell and GHZ states using a measurement based approach upon ancilla qubits.

Each network is made up of layers of interconnected neurons and the nonlinear activation function inside each neuron is one of the key factors that account for the unprecedented achievement of deep learning. Learning how to create quantum neural networks has been a long time pursuit since 1990’s from many researchers, unfortunately without much success. The main challenge is to know how to design a nonlinear activation function inside the quantum neuron, because the laws in quantum mechanics require the operations on quantum neurons that have to be unitary and linear. A recent discovery uses a special quantum circuit technique called repeat-until-success to make a nonlinear activation function inside a quantum neuron, which is the hard part of creating this ...</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kandala, Abhinav</author><author>Mezzacapo, Antonio</author><author>Temme, Kristan</author><author>Takita, Maika</author><author>Brink, Markus</author><author>Chow, Jerry M</author><author>Gambetta, Jay M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver for small molecules and quantum magnets</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>242-246</pages><volume>549</volume><issue>7671</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>0008-5472 (Print)\r0008-5472 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>11507039</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature23879</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Kandala et al. - Nature - Hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver for small molecules and quantum magnets.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23879.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Quantum computers can be used to address molecular structure, materials science and condensed matter physics problems, which currently stretch the limits of existing high-performance computing resources. Finding exact numerical solutions to these interacting fermion problems has exponential cost, while Monte Carlo methods are plagued by the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made even few-atom molecular structures problems of practical interest for medium-sized quantum computers. Yet, thus far experimental implementations have been restricted to molecules involving only Period I elements. Here, we demonstrate the experimental optimization of up to six-qubit Hamiltonian problems with over a hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. This is enabled by a hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver with trial states specifically tailored to the available interactions in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying the technique to a problem of quantum magnetism. Across all studied problems, we find agreement between experiment and numerical simulations with a noisy model of the device. These results help elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems, and aim at bridging the gap between problems at the forefront of high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kakugawa, Satoshi</author><author>Langton, Paul F.</author><author>Zebisch, Matthias</author><author>Howell, Steven A.</author><author>Chang, Tao Hsin</author><author>Liu, Yan</author><author>Feizi, Ten</author><author>Bineva, Ganka</author><author>O'Reilly, Nicola</author><author>Snijders, Ambrosius P.</author><author>Jones, E.

This is achieved in part by Notum, a highly conserved secreted feedback antagonist. Notum has been thought to act as a phospholipase, shedding glypicans and associated Wnt proteins from the cell surface. However, this view fails to explain specificity, as glypicans bind many extracellular ligands. Here we provide genetic evidence in Drosophila that Notum requires glypicans to suppress Wnt signalling, but does not cleave their glycophosphatidylinositol anchor. Structural analyses reveal glycosaminoglycan binding sites on Notum, which probably help Notum to co-localize with Wnt proteins. They also identify, at the active site of human and Drosophila Notum, a large hydrophobic pocket that accommodates palmitoleate. Kinetic and mass spectrometric analyses of human proteins show that Notum is a carboxylesterase that removes an essential palmitoleate moiety from Wnt proteins and thus constitutes the first known extracellular protein deacylase.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paul, Brian J.</author><author>Barker, Melanie M.</author><author>Ross, Wilma</author><author>Schneider, David A.</author><author>Webb, Cathy</author><author>Foster, John W.</author><author>Gourse, Richard L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DksA: A critical component of the transcription initiation machinery that potentiates the regulation of rRNA promoters by ppGpp and the initiating NTP</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>311-322</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><isbn>0092-8674 (Print)</isbn><accession-num>15294157</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2004.07.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2004 - Paul et al. - Cell - DksA A critical component of the transcription initiation machinery that potentiates the regulation of rRNA.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription is regulated primarily at the level of initiation from rRNA promoters. The unusual kinetic properties of these promoters result in their specific regulation by two small molecule signals, ppGpp and the initiating NTP, that bind to RNA polymerase (RNAP) at all promoters. We show here that DksA, a protein previously unsuspected as a transcription factor, is absolutely required for rRNA regulation. In ΔdksA mutants, rRNA promoters are unresponsive to changes in amino acid availability, growth rate, or growth phase. In vitro, DksA binds to RNAP, reduces open complex lifetime, inhibits rRNA promoter activity, and amplifies effects of ppGpp and the initiating NTP on rRNA transcription, explaining the dksA requirement in vivo. These results expand our molecular understanding of rRNA transcription regulation, may explain previously described pleiotropic effects of dksA, and illustrate how transcription factors that do not bind DNA can nevertheless potentiate RNAP for regulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O’Malley, P.

METHODS In this paper we report preliminary results from an ongoing clinical observational &quot;real life&quot; surveillance-based study focused on effects of this therapy on non-motor symptoms and health-related quality of life in a group of patients on apomorphine. RESULTS Apomorphine infusion led to highly significant improvements in UPDRS 3 (p = 0.0003), UPDRS 4 (p = 0.0003), PDQ-8 (Parkinson's disease questionnaire, p = 0.001) and NMSS total (non motor symptoms scale, p = 0.0003). Furthermore, apomorphine was tolerated in patients with visual hallucinations, illusions and paranoid ideations while significant improvement in specific non-motor symptoms such as hyperhidrosis, nocturia, urgency of micturition, and fatigue was recorded. Levodopa equivalent dose decreased significantly (1077.81 ± 446.26 to 458.75 ± 282.29, p &lt; 0.0001) and a large effect size of intervention was noted. In an untreated group no such improvement was noted. The number needed to treat (NNT) for improvement &gt;1 SEM in the Apo group was calculated and was lower than 2 for &gt;1 SEM improvement of UPDRS 3, NMSS, and PDQ-8 total scores. CONCLUSIONS This pilot observational study suggests that non-motor effects are evident with apomorphine therapy and patients suitable for apomorphine deteriorate in the absence of therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Yuhong</author><author>Zhang, Xiaoping</author><author>Ebright, Richard H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of the activating region of catabolite gene activator protein (CAP): isolation and characterization of mutants of CAP specifically defective in transcription activation.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.</full-title></periodical><pages>6081-6085</pages><volume>90</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1993</year></dates><isbn>0027-8424 (Print)</isbn><accession-num>8392187</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.90.13.6081</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://1993 - Zhou, Zhang, Ebright - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. - Identification of the a.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We have isolated 21 mutants of catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) defective in transcription activation at the lac promoter but not defective in DNA binding. The amino acid substitutions in the mutants map to a single region of CAP: amino acids 156-162. As assessed in vitro, the substituted CAP variants are nearly completely unable to activate transcription at the lac promoter but bind to DNA with the same affinity and bend DNA to the same extent as wild-type CAP. Our results establish that amino acids 156-162 are critical for transcription activation at the lac promoter but not for DNA binding and DNA bending. In the structure of CAP, amino acids 156-162 are part of a surface loop. We propose that this surface loop makes a direct protein-protein contact with RNA polymerase at the lac promoter.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goto, Yoshiyuki</author><author>Obata, Takashi</author><author>Jun, Kunisawa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Innate lymphoid cells regulate intestinal epithelial cell glycosylation</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1310-1323</pages><volume>345</volume><issue>6202</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.125400</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Goto, Obata, Jun - Science - Innate lymphoid cells regulate intestinal epithelial cell glycosylation.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chassaing, Benoit</author><author>Koren, Omry</author><author>Goodrich, Julia K.</author><author>Poole, Angela C.</author><author>Srinivasan, Shanthi</author><author>Ley, Ruth E.</author><author>Gewirtz, Andrew T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dietary emulsifiers impact the mouse gut microbiota promoting colitis and metabolic syndrome</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>92-96</pages><volume>519</volume><issue>7541</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><isbn>1476-4687 (Electronic)\r0028-0836 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>25731162</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature14232</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Chassaing et al. - Nature - Dietary emulsifiers impact the mouse gut microbiota promoting colitis and metabolic syndrome.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14232</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The intestinal tract is inhabited by a large and diverse community of microbes collectively referred to as the gut microbiota. While the gut microbiota provides important benefits to its host, especially in metabolism and immune development, disturbance of the microbiota-host relationship is associated with numerous chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and the group of obesity-associated diseases collectively referred to as metabolic syndrome. A primary means by which the intestine is protected from its microbiota is via multi-layered mucus structures that cover the intestinal surface, thereby allowing the vast majority of gut bacteria to be kept at a safe distance from epithelial cells that line the intestine. Thus, agents that disrupt mucus-bacterial interactions might have the potential to promote diseases associated with gut inflammation. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that emulsifiers, detergent-like molecules that are a ubiquitous component of processed foods and that can increase bacterial translocation across epithelia in vitro, might be promoting the increase in inflammatory bowel disease observed since the mid-twentieth century. Here we report that, in mice, relatively low concentrations of two commonly used emulsifiers, namely carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80, induced low-grade inflammation and obesity/metabolic syndrome in wild-type hosts and promoted robust colitis in mice predisposed to this disorder. Emulsifier-induced metabolic syndrome was associated with microbiota encroachment, altered species composition and increased pro-inflammatory potential. Use of germ-free mice and faecal transplants indicated that such changes in microbiota were necessary and sufficient for both low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome. These results support the emerging concept that perturbed host-microbiota interactions resulting in low-grade inflammation can promote adiposity and its associated metabolic effects. Moreover, they suggest that the broad use of emulsifying agents might be contributing to an increased societal incidence of obesity/metabolic syndrome and other chronic inflammatory diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gabanyi, Ilana</author><author>Muller, Paul A.</author><author>Feighery, Linda</author><author>Oliveira, Thiago Y.</author><author>Costa-Pinto, Frederico A.</author><author>Mucida, Daniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>378-391</pages><volume>164</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><isbn>1097-4172 (Electronic)\r0092-8674 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>26777404</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.023</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Gabanyi et al. - Cell - Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.023</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Summary Proper adaptation to environmental perturbations is essential for tissue homeostasis. In the intestine, diverse environmental cues can be sensed by immune cells, which must balance resistance to microorganisms with tolerance, avoiding excess tissue damage. By applying imaging and transcriptional profiling tools, we interrogated how distinct microenvironments in the gut regulate resident macrophages. We discovered that macrophages exhibit a high degree of gene-expression specialization dependent on their proximity to the gut lumen. Lamina propria macrophages (LpMs) preferentially expressed a pro-inflammatory phenotype when compared to muscularis macrophages (MMs), which displayed a tissue-protective phenotype. Upon luminal bacterial infection, MMs further enhanced tissue-protective programs, and this was attributed to swift activation of extrinsic sympathetic neurons innervating the gut muscularis and norepinephrine signaling to β2 adrenergic receptors on MMs. Our results reveal unique intra-tissue macrophage specialization and identify neuro-immune communication between enteric neurons and macrophages that induces rapid tissue-protective responses to distal perturbations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Yi-Jang</author><author>Haigis, Kevin M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Brother's Keeper: Wild-Type Mutant K-Ras Dimers Limit Oncogenesis.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>645-647</pages><volume>172</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29425486</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.019</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Lin, Haigis - Cell - Brother's Keeper Wild-Type Mutant K-Ras Dimers Limit Oncogenesis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.019</url><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867418300564</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29425486</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>K-Ras is the undisputed champion of oncogenes, yet our ability to interfere with its oncogenic function is hampered by insufficient mechanistic understanding.

To gain insight into the pathogenesis of chronic colonic inflammation (colitis), we performed a multiomics analysis that integrated RNA microarray, total protein mass spectrometry (MS), and phosphoprotein MS measurements from a mouse model of the disease. Because we collected all three types of data from individual samples, we tracked information flow from RNA to protein to phosphoprotein and identified signaling molecules that were coordinately or discordantly regulated and pathways that had complex regulation in vivo. For example, the genes encoding acute-phase proteins were expressed in the liver, but the proteins were detected by MS in the colon during inflammation. We also ascertained the types of data that best described particular facets of chronic inflammation. Using gene set enrichment analysis and trans-omics coexpression network analysis, we found that each data set provided a distinct viewpoint on the molecular pathogenesis of colitis. Combining human transcriptomic data with the mouse multiomics data implicated increased p21-activated kinase (Pak) signaling as a driver of colitis. Chemical inhibition of Pak1 and Pak2 with FRAX597 suppressed active colitis in mice. These studies provide translational insights into the mechanisms contributing to colitis and identify Pak as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burkholder, W F</author><author>Kurtser, I</author><author>Grossman, a D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Replication initiation proteins regulate a developmental checkpoint in Bacillus subtilis.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>269-79</pages><volume>104</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Autoradiography</keyword><keyword>Bacillus subtilis</keyword><keyword>Bacillus subtilis: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bacillus subtilis: physiology</keyword><keyword>Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins: antagonists &amp; inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: genetics</keyword><keyword>Bacterial: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>DNA Helicases</keyword><keyword>DNA Helicases: genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA Helicases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication: physiology</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins: chemistry</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>DNA-Binding Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>DnaB Helicases</keyword><keyword>Electrophoresis</keyword><keyword>Genetic</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Open Reading Frames</keyword><keyword>Polyacrylamide Gel</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinase Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinases: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins: genetics</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Sequence Alignment</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Spores</keyword><keyword>Suppression</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: genetics</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors: metabolism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><isbn>0092-8674 (Print)</isbn><accession-num>11207367</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00211-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2001 - Burkholder, Kurtser, Grossman - Cell - Replication initiation proteins regulate a developmental checkpoint in Bacillus subtilis.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11207367</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We identified a signaling pathway that prevents initiation of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis when replication initiation is impaired. We isolated mutations that allow a replication initiation mutant (dnaA) to sporulate. These mutations affect a small open reading frame, sda, that was overexpressed in replication initiation mutants and appears to be directly regulated by DnaA. Mutations in replication initiation genes inhibit the onset of sporulation by preventing activation of a transcription factor required for sporulation, Spo0A. Deletion of sda restored activation of Spo0A in replication initiation mutants. Overexpression of sda in otherwise wild-type cells inhibited activation of Spo0A and sporulation. Purified Sda inhibited a histidine kinase needed for activation of Spo0A. Our results indicate that control of sda by DnaA establishes a checkpoint that inhibits activation of Spo0A and prevents futile attempts to initiate sporulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hartwell, L H</author><author>Weinert, T A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Checkpoints: controls that ensure the order of cell cycle events.</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><pages>629-34</pages><volume>246</volume><issue>4930</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1989</year></dates><isbn>0036-8075 (Print)\r0036-8075</isbn><accession-num>2683079</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.2683079</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://1989 - Hartwell, Weinert - Science (New York, N.Y.) - Checkpoints controls that ensure the order of cell cycle events.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.2683079</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2683079</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The events of the cell cycle of most organisms are ordered into dependent pathways in which the initiation of late events is dependent on the completion of early events. In eukaryotes, for example, mitosis is dependent on the completion of DNA synthesis. Some dependencies can be relieved by mutation (mitosis may then occur before completion of DNA synthesis), suggesting that the dependency is due to a control mechanism and not an intrinsic feature of the events themselves. Control mechanisms enforcing dependency in the cell cycle are here called checkpoints. Elimination of checkpoints may result in cell death, infidelity in the distribution of chromosomes or other organelles, or increased susceptibility to environmental perturbations such as DNA damaging agents. It appears that some checkpoints are eliminated during the early embryonic development of some organisms; this fact may pose special problems for the fidelity of embryonic cell division.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martinez-Moya, Pilar</author><author>Niehaus, Karsten</author><author>Alcaíno, Jennifer</author><author>Baeza, Marcelo</author><author>Cifuentes, Víctor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Proteomic and metabolomic analysis of the carotenogenic yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous using different carbon sources</title><secondary-title>BMC Genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Genomics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-18</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Astaxanthin</keyword><keyword>Carbon source</keyword><keyword>Carotenogenesis</keyword><keyword>Metabolomics</keyword><keyword>Proteomics</keyword><keyword>ROS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1471-2180</isbn><accession-num>21669001</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12864-015-1484-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Martinez-Moya et al. - BMC Genomics - Proteomic and metabolomic analysis of the carotenogenic yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous is used for the microbiological production of the antioxidant carotenoid astaxanthin.

These include succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate hydratase, both enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, to date, the mechanisms by which defects in the TCA cycle contribute to tumor formation have not been elucidated. Here we describe a mitochondrion-to-cytosol signaling pathway that links mitochondrial dysfunction to oncogenic events: succinate, which accumulates as a result of SDH inhibition, inhibits HIF-alpha prolyl hydroxylases in the cytosol, leading to stabilization and activation of HIF-1alpha. These results suggest a mechanistic link between SDH mutations and HIF-1alpha induction, providing an explanation for the highly vascular tumors that develop in the absence of VHL mutations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davenport, Peter W.</author><author>Griffin, Julian L.</author><author>Welch, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quorum sensing is accompanied by global metabolic changes in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title><secondary-title>Journal of Bacteriology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Bacteriology</full-title></periodical><pages>2072-2082</pages><volume>197</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1098-5530 (Electronic)\r0021-9193 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>25868647</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JB.02557-14</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Davenport, Griffin, Welch - Journal of Bacteriology - Quorum sensing is accompanied by global metabolic changes in the opportunis.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>UNLABELLED: Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-dependent quorum sensing (QS) systems to control the expression of secreted effectors. These effectors can be crucial to the ecological fitness of the bacterium, playing roles in nutrient acquisition, microbial competition, and virulence. In this study, we investigated the metabolic consequences of AHL-dependent QS by monitoring the metabolic profile(s) of a lasI rhlI double mutant (unable to make QS signaling molecules) and its wild-type progenitor as they progressed through the growth curve. Analysis of culture supernatants by (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy revealed that at the point where AHL concentrations peaked in the wild type, the metabolic footprints (i.e., extracellular metabolites) of the wild-type and lasI rhlI mutant diverged. Subsequent gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based analysis of the intracellular metabolome revealed QS-dependent perturbations in around one-third of all identified metabolites, including altered concentrations of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, amino acids, and fatty acids. Further targeted fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) GC-MS-based profiling of the cellular total fatty acid pools revealed that QS leads to changes associated with decreased membrane fluidity and higher chemical stability. However, not all of the changes we observed were necessarily a direct consequence of QS; liquid chromatography (LC)-MS analyses revealed that polyamine levels were elevated in the lasI rhlI mutant, perhaps a response to the absence of QS-dependent adaptations. Our data suggest that QS leads to a global readjustment in central metabolism and provide new insight into the metabolic changes associated with QS during stationary-phase adaptation. IMPORTANCE: Quorum sensing (QS) is a transcriptional regulatory mechanism that allows bacteria to coordinate their gene expression profile with the population cell density. The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses QS to control the production of secreted virulence factors. In this study, we show that QS elicits a global &quot;metabolic rewiring&quot; in P. aeruginosa. This metabolic rerouting of fluxes is consistent with a variety of drivers, ranging from altered QS-dependent transcription of &quot;metabolic genes&quot; through to the effect(s) of global &quot;metabolic readjustment&quot; as a consequence of QS-dependent exoproduct synthesis, as well as a general stress response, among others. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to assess the global impact of QS on the metabolome.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goo, Eunhye</author><author>An, Jae Hyung</author><author>Kang, Yongsung</author><author>Hwang, Ingyu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Control of bacterial metabolism by quorum sensing.</title><secondary-title>Trends in microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>567-76</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Burkholderia</keyword><keyword>cooperativity</keyword><keyword>metabolic slowing</keyword><keyword>oxalate</keyword><keyword>public goods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><isbn>0966842X (ISSN)</isbn><accession-num>26072043</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tim.2015.05.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Goo et al. - Trends in microbiology - Control of bacterial metabolism by quorum sensing.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2015.05.007</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26072043</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Bacterial quorum sensing (QS)-dependent gene expression is a dynamic response to cell density. Bacteria produce costly public goods for the benefit of the population as a whole. As an example, QS rewires cellular metabolism to produce oxalate (a public good) to enable survival during the stationary phase in Burkholderia glumae, Burkholderia thailandensis, and Burkholderia pseudomallei. Recent reports showed that QS serves as a metabolic brake to maintain homeostatic primary metabolism in B. glumae and readjusts the central metabolism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this review, we emphasize the dynamics and complexity of the control of gene expression by QS and discuss the metabolic costs and possible metabolic options to sustain cooperativity. We then focus on how QS influences bacterial central metabolism.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jährling, Nina</author><author>Becker, Klaus</author><author>Schönbauer, Cornelia</author><author>Schnorrer, Frank</author><author>Dodt, Hans-Ulrich</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Three-dimensional reconstruction and segmentation of intact Drosophila by ultramicroscopy.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in systems neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in systems neuroscience</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>February</issue><keywords><keyword>Drosophila</keyword><keyword>flight muscle</keyword><keyword>imaging</keyword><keyword>light sheet microscopy</keyword><keyword>morphology</keyword><keyword>phenotyping</keyword><keyword>segmentation</keyword><keyword>ultramicroscopy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1662-5137 (Electronic)\r1662-5137 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>20204156</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/neuro.06.001.2010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - Jährling et al. - Frontiers in systems neuroscience - Three-dimensional reconstruction and segmentation of intact Drosophila by.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/neuro.06.001.2010/abstract</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20204156</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2831709</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Genetic mutants are invaluable for understanding the development, physiology and behaviour of Drosophila. Modern molecular genetic techniques enable the rapid generation of large numbers of different mutants. To phenotype these mutants sophisticated microscopy techniques are required, ideally allowing the 3D-reconstruction of the anatomy of an adult fly from a single scan. Ultramicroscopy enables up to cm fields of view, whilst providing micron resolution. In this paper, we present ultramicroscopy reconstructions of the flight musculature, the nervous system, and the digestive tract of entire, chemically cleared, drosophila in autofluorescent light. The 3D-reconstructions thus obtained verify that the anatomy of a whole fly, including the filigree spatial organization of the direct flight muscles, can be analysed from a single ultramicroscopy reconstruction. The recording procedure, including 3D-reconstruction using standard software, takes no longer than 30 min. Additionally, image segmentation, which would allow for further quantitative analysis, was performed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burbulys, David</author><author>Trach, Kathleen A</author><author>Hoch, James A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Initiation of sporulation in B. subtilis is controlled by a multicomponent phosphorelay.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>545-52</pages><volume>64</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1991</year></dates><isbn>0092-8674 (Print)</isbn><accession-num>1846779</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0092-8674(91)90238-T</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://1991 - Burbulys, Trach, Hoch - Cell - Initiation of sporulation in B. subtilis is controlled by a multicomponent phosphorelay.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1846779</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Stage 0 sporulation (spo0) mutants of Bacillus subtilis are defective in the signal transduction system initiating sporulation. Two of the products of these genes, Spo0A and Spo0F, are related to response regulator components of two-component regulatory systems used to control environmental responses in bacteria. The Spo0F response regulator was found to be the primary substrate for phosphorylation by the sporulation-specific protein kinase, KinA. Phosphorylated Spo0F was the phosphodonor for a phosphotransferase, Spo0B, which transferred the phosphate group to the second response regulator, the transcription regulatory protein Spo0A. This phosphorelay provides a mechanism for signal gathering from several protein kinases using Spo0F as a secondary messenger. These divergent signals are integrated through Spo0B phosphotransferase to activate the Spo0A transcription factor. This system provides for many levels of control to prevent capricious induction of sporulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hastie, Jessica L.</author><author>Williams, Kyle B.</author><author>Sepúlveda, Carolina</author><author>Houtman, Jon C.</author><author>Forest, Katrina T.</author><author>Ellermeier, Craig D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence of a bacterial receptor for lysozyme: binding of lysozyme to the anti-σ factor RsiV controls activation of the ecf σ factor σV.</title><secondary-title>PLoS genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>e1004643</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1553-7404 (Electronic)\r1553-7390 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>25275625</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1004643</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Hastie et al. - PLoS genetics - Evidence of a bacterial receptor for lysozyme binding of lysozyme to the anti-σ factor RsiV co.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275625</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4183432</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>σ factors endow RNA polymerase with promoter specificity in bacteria. Extra-Cytoplasmic Function (ECF) σ factors represent the largest and most diverse family of σ factors. Most ECF σ factors must be activated in response to an external signal. One mechanism of activation is the stepwise proteolytic destruction of an anti-σ factor via Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP). In most cases, the site-1 protease required to initiate the RIP process directly senses the signal. Here we report a new mechanism in which the anti-σ factor rather than the site-1 protease is the sensor. We provide evidence suggesting that the anti-σ factor RsiV is the bacterial receptor for the innate immune defense enzyme, lysozyme. The site-1 cleavage site is similar to the recognition site of signal peptidase and cleavage at this site is required for σV activation in Bacillus subtilis. We reconstitute site-1 cleavage in vitro and demonstrate that it requires both signal peptidase and lysozyme. We demonstrate that the anti-σ factor RsiV directly binds to lysozyme and muramidase activity is not required for σV activation. We propose a model in which the binding of lysozyme to RsiV activates RsiV for signal peptidase cleavage at site-1, initiating proteolytic destruction of RsiV and activation of σV. This suggests a novel mechanism in which conformational change in a substrate controls the cleavage susceptibility for signal peptidase. Thus, unlike other ECF σ factors which require regulated intramembrane proteolysis for activation, the sensor for σV activation is not the site-1 protease but the anti-σ factor.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>DeVoss, Jason</author><author>Hou, Yafei</author><author>Johannes, Kellsey</author><author>Lu, Wen</author><author>Liou, Gregory I.</author><author>Rinn, John</author><author>Chang, Howard</author><author>Caspi, Rachel R.</author><author>Caspi, Rachel</author><author>Fong, Lawrence</author><author>Anderson, Mark S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spontaneous autoimmunity prevented by thymic expression of a single self-antigen.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of experimental medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of experimental medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2727-35</pages><volume>203</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>0022-1007 (Print)\r0022-1007 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>17116738</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1084/jem.20061864</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2006 - DeVoss et al. - The Journal of experimental medicine - Spontaneous autoimmunity prevented by thymic expression of a single self-a.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jem.org/lookup/doi/10.1084/jem.20061864</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17116738</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC2118158</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The expression of self-antigen in the thymus is believed to be responsible for the deletion of autoreactive T lymphocytes, a critical process in the maintenance of unresponsiveness to self. The Autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene, which is defective in the disorder autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1, has been shown to promote the thymic expression of self-antigens. A clear link, however, between specific thymic self-antigens and a single autoimmune phenotype in this model has been lacking. We show that autoimmune eye disease in aire-deficient mice develops as a result of loss of thymic expression of a single eye antigen, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). In addition, lack of IRBP expression solely in the thymus, even in the presence of aire expression, is sufficient to trigger spontaneous eye-specific autoimmunity. These results suggest that failure of thymic expression of selective single self-antigens can be sufficient to cause organ-specific autoimmune disease, even in otherwise self-tolerant individuals.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Siyoung</author><author>Fujikado, Noriyuki</author><author>Kolodin, Dmitriy</author><author>Benoist, Christophe</author><author>Mathis, Diane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Immune tolerance.

Expression of Aire during a perinatal age window is necessary and sufficient to prevent the multiorgan autoimmunity characteristic of Aire-deficient mice. We report that Aire promotes the perinatal generation of a distinct compartment of Foxp3(+)CD4(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells, which stably persists in adult mice. This population has a role in maintaining self-tolerance, a transcriptome and an activation profile distinguishable from those of Tregs produced in adults. Underlying the distinct Treg populations are age-dependent, Aire-independent differences in the processing and presentation of thymic stromal-cell peptides, resulting in different T cell receptor repertoires. Our findings expand the notion of a developmentally layered immune system.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Derbinski, Jens</author><author>Schulte, Antje</author><author>Kyewski, Bruno</author><author>Klein, Ludger</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Promiscuous gene expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells mirrors the peripheral self.</title><secondary-title>Nature immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>1032-9</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><isbn>1529-2908 (Print)\n1529-2908 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>11600886</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ni723</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2001 - Derbinski et al. - Nature immunology - Promiscuous gene expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells mirrors the peripheral se.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11600886</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Expression of peripheral antigens in the thymus has been implicated in T cell tolerance and autoimmunity.

Although unclear why, head-on transcription (lagging strand genes) is especially disruptive to replication and promotes genomic instability. Here, we find that head-on collisions promote R-loop formation in Bacillus subtilis. We show that pervasive R-loop formation at head-on collision regions completely blocks replication, elevates mutagenesis, and inhibits gene expression. Accordingly, the activity of the R-loop processing enzyme RNase HIII at collision regions is crucial for stress survival in B. subtilis, as many stress response genes are head-on to replication. Remarkably, without RNase HIII, the ability of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to infect and replicate in hosts is weakened significantly, most likely because many virulence genes are head-on to replication. We conclude that the detrimental effects of head-on collisions stem primarily from excessive R-loop formation and that the resolution of these structures is critical for bacterial stress survival and pathogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jia, Yong</author><author>Yun, Cai-Hong</author><author>Park, Eunyoung</author><author>Ercan, Dalia</author><author>Manuia, Mari</author><author>Juarez, Jose</author><author>Xu, Chunxiao</author><author>Rhee, Kevin</author><author>Chen, Ting</author><author>Zhang, Haikuo</author><author>Palakurthi, Sangeetha</author><author>Jang, Jaebong</author><author>Lelais, Gerald</author><author>DiDonato, Michael</author><author>Bursulaya, Badry</author><author>Michellys, Pierre-Yves</author><author>Epple, Robert</author><author>Marsilje, Thomas H.</author><author>McNeill, Matthew</author><author>Lu, Wenshuo</author><author>Harris, Jennifer</author><author>Bender, Steven</author><author>Wong, Kwok-Kin</author><author>Jänne, Pasi A.</author><author>Eck, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Overcoming EGFR(T790M) and EGFR(C797S) resistance with mutant-selective allosteric inhibitors.</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>129-32</pages><volume>534</volume><issue>7605</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><isbn>1476-4687 (Electronic)\r0028-0836 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>27251290</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature17960</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Jia et al. - Nature - Overcoming EGFR(T790M) and EGFR(C797S) resistance with mutant-selective allosteric inhibitors.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature17960</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27251290</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4929832</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib are approved treatments for non-small cell lung cancers harbouring activating mutations in the EGFR kinase, but resistance arises rapidly, most frequently owing to the secondary T790M mutation within the ATP site of the receptor. Recently developed mutant-selective irreversible inhibitors are highly active against the T790M mutant, but their efficacy can be compromised by acquired mutation of C797, the cysteine residue with which they form a key covalent bond. All current EGFR TKIs target the ATP-site of the kinase, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents with alternative mechanisms of action. Here we describe the rational discovery of EAI045, an allosteric inhibitor that targets selected drug-resistant EGFR mutants but spares the wild-type receptor. The crystal structure shows that the compound binds an allosteric site created by the displacement of the regulatory C-helix in an inactive conformation of the kinase. The compound inhibits L858R/T790M-mutant EGFR with low-nanomolar potency in biochemical assays. However, as a single agent it is not effective in blocking EGFR-driven proliferation in cells owing to differential potency on the two subunits of the dimeric receptor, which interact in an asymmetric manner in the active state. We observe marked synergy of EAI045 with cetuximab, an antibody therapeutic that blocks EGFR dimerization, rendering the kinase uniformly susceptible to the allosteric agent. EAI045 in combination with cetuximab is effective in mouse models of lung cancer driven by EGFR(L858R/T790M) and by EGFR(L858R/T790M/C797S), a mutant that is resistant to all currently available EGFR TKIs. More generally, our findings illustrate the utility of purposefully targeting allosteric sites to obtain mutant-selective inhibitors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Eunyoung</author><author>Kim, Nayoung</author><author>Ficarro, Scott B</author><author>Zhang, Yi</author><author>Lee, Byung Il</author><author>Cho, Ahye</author><author>Kim, Kihong</author><author>Park, Angela K J</author><author>Park, Woong-Yang</author><author>Murray, Bradley</author><author>Meyerson, Matthew</author><author>Beroukhim, Rameen</author><author>Marto, Jarrod A</author><author>Cho, Jeonghee</author><author>Eck, Michael J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structure and mechanism of activity-based inhibition of the EGF receptor by Mig6.</title><secondary-title>Nature structural &amp; molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature structural &amp; molecular biology</full-title></periodical><pages>703-711</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><accession-num>26280531</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nsmb.3074</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Park et al. - Nature structural &amp; molecular biology - Structure and mechanism of activity-based inhibition of the EGF receptor by.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nsmb.3074</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26280531</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4790445</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mig6 is a feedback inhibitor that directly binds, inhibits and drives internalization of ErbB-family receptors. Mig6 selectively targets activated receptors. Here we found that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylates Mig6 on Y394 and that this phosphorylation is primed by prior phosphorylation of an adjacent residue, Y395, by Src. Crystal structures of human EGFR-Mig6 complexes reveal the structural basis for enhanced phosphorylation of primed Mig6 and show how Mig6 rearranges after phosphorylation by EGFR to effectively irreversibly inhibit the same receptor that catalyzed its phosphorylation. This dual phosphorylation site allows Mig6 to inactivate EGFR in a manner that requires activation of the target receptor and that can be modulated by Src. Loss of Mig6 is a driving event in human cancer; analysis of 1,057 gliomas reveals frequent focal deletions of ERRFI1, the gene that encodes Mig6, in EGFR-amplified glioblastomas.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Poulin, Emily J</author><author>Haigis, Kevin M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>No back seat for a progression event—K-RAS as a therapeutic target in CRC</title><secondary-title>Genes &amp; Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes &amp; Development</full-title></periodical><pages>333-335</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>10</keyword><keyword>1101</keyword><keyword>297630</keyword><keyword>apc</keyword><keyword>article is online at</keyword><keyword>bidmc</keyword><keyword>cgi</keyword><keyword>colorectal cancer</keyword><keyword>corresponding author</keyword><keyword>doi</keyword><keyword>edu</keyword><keyword>gad</keyword><keyword>genesdev</keyword><keyword>harvard</keyword><keyword>http</keyword><keyword>invasion</keyword><keyword>khaigis</keyword><keyword>kras</keyword><keyword>metastasis</keyword><keyword>org</keyword><keyword>p53</keyword><keyword>www</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gad.297630.117</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Poulin, Haigis - Genes &amp; Development - No back seat for a progression event—K-RAS as a therapeutic target in CRC.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/31/4/333.abstract</url><url>http://genesdev.cshlp.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/gad.297630.117</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer and plays a central, although poorly understood, role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression.

Our aim is to identify clinical, morphological, and genetic features characteristic of intra-pancreatic distal bile duct carcinoma. METHODS Clinicopathologic data of 550 patients undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy between September 1990 and May 2008 were reviewed. KRAS status was assessed with mass-spectrometric genotyping. RESULTS Ninety-seven patients with intra-pancreatic adenocarcinomas surrounding the CBD were identified; slides were available for 80. Two relationships with the CBD were recognized as follows: type I (n = 42): cancer grew concentrically around the CBD and type II (n = 38): cancer grew asymmetrically around the CBD. Type I adenocarcinomas were associated with high-grade biliary dysplasia (45 vs. 13 %; p = 0.003); type II were associated with high-grade pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PanIN-2 or -3) (39 vs. 9 %; p = 0.003). Type I tumors had a better median survival (46 months) compared to type II (23 months) or other PDAC (20 months) (p &lt; 0.001). Mutated KRAS was identified in 3/26 (11 %) type I and 20/21 (95 %) type II cancers (p &lt; 0.001). There may be poorer survival in the presence of a KRAS mutation than wild-type KRAS (22.9 vs. 41.6 months; p = 0.3). CONCLUSIONS Distal periductal adenocarcinomas fall into two distinct groups with biologic, morphologic and genetic differences. Those growing symmetrically around the CBD are more likely to be intra-pancreatic distal bile duct carcinomas and are associated with improved survival whereas cancers with asymmetric growth are more likely to have KRAS mutations and to be PDACs. These findings facilitate a more accurate histopathological diagnosis, which could improve patient selection for therapeutic trials.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martin, Timothy D</author><author>Cook, Danielle R</author><author>Choi, Mei Yuk</author><author>Li, Mamie Z</author><author>Haigis, Kevin M</author><author>Elledge, Stephen J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Role for Mitochondrial Translation in Promotion of Viability in K-Ras Mutant Cells.</title><secondary-title>Cell reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell reports</full-title></periodical><pages>427-438</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>CRISPR</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>genetic screen</keyword><keyword>mitochondria</keyword><keyword>mitochondrial translation</keyword><keyword>mitoribosome</keyword><keyword>oxidative phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>shRNA</keyword><keyword>synthetic lethal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28700943</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.celrep.2017.06.061</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Martin et al. - Cell reports - A Role for Mitochondrial Translation in Promotion of Viability in K-Ras Mutant Cells.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.06.061</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28700943</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5553568</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Activating mutations in the KRAS oncogene are highly prevalent in tumors, especially those of the colon, lung, and pancreas. To better understand the genetic dependencies that K-Ras mutant cells rely upon for their growth, we employed whole-genome CRISPR loss-of-function screens in two isogenic pairs of cell lines. Since loss of essential genes is uniformly toxic in CRISPR-based screens, we also developed a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) library targeting essential genes. These approaches uncovered a large set of proteins whose loss results in the selective reduction of K-Ras mutant cell growth. Pathway analysis revealed that many of these genes function in the mitochondria. For validation, we generated isogenic pairs of cell lines using CRISPR-based genome engineering, which confirmed the dependency of K-Ras mutant cells on these mitochondrial pathways. Finally, we found that mitochondrial inhibitors reduce the growth of K-Ras mutant tumors in vivo, aiding in the advancement of strategies to target K-Ras-driven malignancy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Siqi</author><author>Balmain, Allan</author><author>Counter, Christopher M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A model for RAS mutation patterns in cancers: finding the sweet spot.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

Interestingly, there are rather distinct patterns to RAS mutations; the isoform mutated as well as the position and type of substitution vary between different cancers. As RAS genes are among the earliest, if not the first, genes mutated in a variety of cancers, understanding how these mutation patterns arise could inform on not only how cancer begins but also the factors influencing this event, which has implications for cancer prevention. To this end, we suggest that there is a narrow window or 'sweet spot' by which oncogenic RAS signalling can promote tumour initiation in normal cells. As a consequence, RAS mutation patterns in each normal cell are a product of the specific RAS isoform mutated, as well as the position of the mutation and type of substitution to achieve an ideal level of signalling.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haigis, Kevin M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KRAS Alleles: The Devil Is in the Detail.</title><secondary-title>Trends in cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>686-697</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>RAS</keyword><keyword>alleles</keyword><keyword>cancer genetics</keyword><keyword>oncogene</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>28958387</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.trecan.2017.08.006</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Haigis - Trends in cancer - KRAS Alleles The Devil Is in the Detail.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2405803317301632/1-s2.0-S2405803317301632-main.pdf?_tid=13f1b36c-b429-11e7-b703-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1508347598_96c85c3378c1a351752ddcd83d873a8a</url><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405803317301632</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer and KRAS mutation is commonly associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. Since the KRAS oncoprotein is, as yet, not directly druggable, efforts to target KRAS mutant cancers focus on identifying vulnerabilities in downstream signaling pathways or in stress response pathways that are permissive for strong oncogenic signaling. One aspect of KRAS biology that is not well appreciated is the potential biological differences between the many distinct KRAS activating mutations. This review draws upon insights from both clinical and experimental studies to explore similarities and differences among KRAS alleles. Historical and emerging evidence supports the notion that the specific biology related to each allele might be exploitable for allele-specific therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Roock, Wendy</author><author>Jonker, Derek J</author><author>Di Nicolantonio, Federica</author><author>Sartore-Bianchi, Andrea</author><author>Tu, Dongsheng</author><author>Siena, Salvatore</author><author>Lamba, Simona</author><author>Arena, Sabrina</author><author>Frattini, Milo</author><author>Piessevaux, Hubert</author><author>Van Cutsem, Eric</author><author>O'Callaghan, Chris J</author><author>Khambata-Ford, Shirin</author><author>Zalcberg, John R</author><author>Simes, John</author><author>Karapetis, Christos S</author><author>Bardelli, Alberto</author><author>Tejpar, Sabine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association of KRAS p.G13D mutation with outcome in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab.</title><secondary-title>JAMA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA</full-title></periodical><pages>1812-20</pages><volume>304</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><accession-num>20978259</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jama.2010.1535</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2010 - De Roock et al. - JAMA - Association of KRAS p.G13D mutation with outcome in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic col.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20978259</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>CONTEXT Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have KRAS codon 12- or KRAS codon 13-mutated tumors are presently excluded from treatment with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab.

The effect of the different mutations was studied in vitro by constructing isogenic cell lines with wild-type KRAS, p.G12V, or p.G13D mutant alleles and treating them with cetuximab. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main efficacy end point was overall survival. Secondary efficacy end points were response rate and progression-free survival. RESULTS In comparison with patients with other KRAS-mutated tumors, patients with p.G13D-mutated tumors (n = 32) treated with cetuximab had longer overall survival (median, 7.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 5.7-20.5] months vs 5.7 [95% CI, 4.9-6.8] months; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.81; P = .005) and longer progression-free survival (median, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.9-6.2] months vs 1.9 [95% CI, 1.8-2.8] months; adjusted HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.81; P = .004). There was a significant interaction between KRAS mutation status (p.G13D vs other KRAS mutations) and overall survival benefit with cetuximab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14-0.67; P = .003). In vitro and mouse model analysis showed that although p.G12V-mutated colorectal cells were insensitive to cetuximab, p.G13D-mutated cells were sensitive, as were KRAS wild-type cells. CONCLUSIONS In this analysis, use of cetuximab was associated with longer overall and progression-free survival among patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer with p.G13D-mutated tumors than with other KRAS-mutated tumors. Evaluation of cetuximab therapy in these tumors in prospective randomized trials may be warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bournet, Barbara</author><author>Muscari, Fabrice</author><author>Buscail, Camille</author><author>Assenat, Eric</author><author>Barthet, Marc</author><author>Hammel, Pascal</author><author>Selves, Janick</author><author>Guimbaud, Rosine</author><author>Cordelier, Pierre</author><author>Buscail, Louis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KRAS G12D Mutation Subtype Is A Prognostic Factor for Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.</title><secondary-title>Clinical and translational gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical and translational gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>e157</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>2155-384X (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>27010960</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ctg.2016.18</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Bournet et al. - Clinical and translational gastroenterology - KRAS G12D Mutation Subtype Is A Prognostic Factor for Advanced Pan.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/ctg</url><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ctg.2016.18</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27010960</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4822095</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>OBJECTIVES There is no molecular biomarker available in the clinical practice to assess the prognosis of advanced pancreatic carcinoma. This multicenter prospective study aimed to investigate the role of KRAS mutation subtypes within the primary tumor to determine the prognosis of advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS The exon-2 KRAS mutation status was tested on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy material (primary tumor; restriction fragment-length polymorphism plus sequencing and TaqMan allelic discrimination) of patients with proven locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We used the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox's model to evaluate the impact of KRAS status on the overall survival (OS), adjusting for age, stage of disease, clinical performance status, CA 19-9 levels, and treatment. RESULTS A total of 219 patients (men: 116; mean age: 67±9.4 years) were included: 147 harbored a codon-12 KRAS mutation (G12D: 73; G12V: 53; G12R: 21) and 72 had a wild-type KRAS. There was no difference in the OS between patients with a mutant KRAS (8 months; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 8.7-12.3) and the wild-type (9 months; 95% CI: 8.7-12.8; hazard ratio (HR): 1.03; P=0.82). However, the patients with a G12D mutation had a significantly shorter OS (6 months; 95% CI: 6.4-9.7) compared with the other patients (OS: 9 months; 95% CI: 10-13; HR: 1.47; P=0.003; i.e., wild type: 9 months, G12V: 9 months, G12R: 14 months). Similar results were observed in the subgroup of 162 patients who received chemotherapy (HR: 1.66; P=0.0013; G12D (n=49): 8 months, wild type (n=56): 10 months, G12V (n=38): 10 months, G12R (n=19): 14 months). Multivariate analyses identified KRAS G12D as an independent predictor for worse prognosis within the entire series (HR: 1.44; P=0.01) and in the subgroup of patients that received chemotherapy (HR: 1.84; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS The KRAS G12D mutation subtype is an independent prognostic marker for advanced pancreatic ductal carcinoma. Codon and amino-acid-specific mutations of KRAS should be considered when evaluating the prognoses as well as in trials testing drugs that target RAS and downstream RAS pathways.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hunter, John C</author><author>Manandhar, Anuj</author><author>Carrasco, Martin A</author><author>Gurbani, Deepak</author><author>Gondi, Sudershan</author><author>Westover, Kenneth D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Common Cancer-Associated KRAS Mutations.</title><secondary-title>Molecular cancer research : MCR</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cancer research : MCR</full-title></periodical><pages>1325-35</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1557-3125 (Electronic) 1541-7786 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>26037647</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-15-0203</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2015 - Hunter et al. - Molecular cancer research MCR - Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Common Cancer-Associated KRAS Mutations.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/13/9/1325.full.pdf</url><url>http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-15-0203</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26037647</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>UNLABELLED KRAS mutations are the most common genetic abnormalities in cancer, but the distribution of specific mutations across cancers and the differential responses of patients with specific KRAS mutations in therapeutic clinical trials suggest that different KRAS mutations have unique biochemical behaviors. To further explain these high-level clinical differences and to explore potential therapeutic strategies for specific KRAS isoforms, we characterized the most common KRAS mutants biochemically for substrate binding kinetics, intrinsic and GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-stimulated GTPase activities, and interactions with the RAS effector, RAF kinase. Of note, KRAS G13D shows rapid nucleotide exchange kinetics compared with other mutants analyzed. This property can be explained by changes in the electrostatic charge distribution of the active site induced by the G13D mutation as shown by X-ray crystallography. High-resolution X-ray structures are also provided for the GDP-bound forms of KRAS G12V, G12R, and Q61L and reveal additional insight. Overall, the structural data and measurements, obtained herein, indicate that measurable biochemical properties provide clues for identifying KRAS-driven tumors that preferentially signal through RAF. IMPLICATIONS Biochemical profiling and subclassification of KRAS-driven cancers will enable the rational selection of therapies targeting specific KRAS isoforms or specific RAS effectors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ihle, Nathan T.</author><author>Byers, Lauren A.</author><author>Kim, Edward S.</author><author>Saintigny, Pierre</author><author>Lee, J.

Most mutations occur at codons 12 and 13. In colorectal cancer, the presence of any mutant KRas amino acid substitution is a negative predictor of patient response to targeted therapy. However, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the evidence that KRAS mutation is a predictive factor is conflicting. METHODS We used data from a molecularly targeted clinical trial for 215 patients with tissues available out of 268 evaluable patients with refractory NSCLC to examine associations between specific mutant KRas proteins and progression-free survival and tumor gene expression. Transcriptome microarray studies of patient tumor samples and reverse-phase protein array studies of a panel of 67 NSCLC cell lines with known substitutions in KRas and in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells stably expressing different mutant KRas proteins were used to investigate signaling pathway activation. Molecular modeling was used to study the conformations of wild-type and mutant KRas proteins. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to analyze survival data. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS Patients whose tumors had either mutant KRas-Gly12Cys or mutant KRas-Gly12Val had worse progression-free survival compared with patients whose tumors had other mutant KRas proteins or wild-type KRas (P = .046, median survival = 1.84 months) compared with all other mutant KRas (median survival = 3.35 months) or wild-type KRas (median survival = 1.95 months). NSCLC cell lines with mutant KRas-Gly12Asp had activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-K) and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) signaling, whereas those with mutant KRas-Gly12Cys or mutant KRas-Gly12Val had activated Ral signaling and decreased growth factor-dependent Akt activation. Molecular modeling studies showed that different conformations imposed by mutant KRas may lead to altered association with downstream signaling transducers. CONCLUSIONS Not all mutant KRas proteins affect patient survival or downstream signaling in a similar way. The heterogeneous behavior of mutant KRas proteins implies that therapeutic interventions may need to take into account the specific mutant KRas expressed by the tumor.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pantsar, Tatu</author><author>Rissanen, Sami</author><author>Dauch, Daniel</author><author>Laitinen, Tuomo</author><author>Vattulainen, Ilpo</author><author>Poso, Antti</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of mutation probabilities of KRAS G12 missense mutants and their long-timescale dynamics by atomistic molecular simulations and Markov state modeling.</title><secondary-title>PLoS computational biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS computational biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e1006458</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>1111111111</isbn><accession-num>30199525</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006458</electronic-resource-num><notes>&amp;quot;Interestingly, the GTP-bound G12D mutant displays almost identical interactions with the wild-type.&amp;quot;

Traditionally, the oncogenic properties of KRAS missense mutants at position 12 (G12X) have been considered as equal. Here, by assessing the probabilities of occurrence of all KRAS G12X mutations and KRAS dynamics we show that this assumption does not hold true. Instead, our findings revealed an outstanding mutational bias. We conducted a thorough mutational analysis of KRAS G12X mutations and assessed to what extent the observed mutation frequencies follow a random distribution. Unique tissue-specific frequencies are displayed with specific mutations, especially with G12R, which cannot be explained by random probabilities. To clarify the underlying causes for the nonrandom probabilities, we conducted extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (170 μs) to study the differences of G12X mutations on a molecular level. The simulations revealed an allosteric hydrophobic signaling network in KRAS, and that protein dynamics is altered among the G12X mutants and as such differs from the wild-type and is mutation-specific. The shift in long-timescale conformational dynamics was confirmed with Markov state modeling. A G12X mutation was found to modify KRAS dynamics in an allosteric way, which is especially manifested in the switch regions that are responsible for the effector protein binding. The findings provide a basis to understand better the oncogenic properties of KRAS G12X mutants and the consequences of the observed nonrandom frequencies of specific G12X mutations.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Suyan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of monotonically differentially expressed genes for non-small cell lung cancer.</title><secondary-title>BMC bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>177</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adenocarcinoma</keyword><keyword>Feature selection</keyword><keyword>Monotonically expressed genes (MEGs)</keyword><keyword>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</keyword><keyword>Overall survival</keyword><keyword>Pathologic stages</keyword><keyword>Squamous cell carcinoma</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><isbn>1285901927758</isbn><accession-num>30971213</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-019-2775-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Tian - BMC bioinformatics - Identification of monotonically differentially expressed genes for non-small cell lung cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2775-8</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971213</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6458730</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND Monotonically expressed genes (MEGs) are genes whose expression values increase or decrease monotonically as a disease advances or time proceeds. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a multistage progression process resulting from genetic sequences mutations, the identification of MEGs for NSCLC is important. RESULTS With the aid of a feature selection algorithm capable of identifying MEGs - the MFSelector method - two sets of potential MEGs were selected in this study: the MEGs across the different pathologic stages and the MEGs across the risk levels of death for the NSCLC patients at early stages. For the lung adenocarcinoma (AC) subtypes no statistically significant MEGs were identified across pathologic stages, however dozens of MEGs were identified across the risk levels of death. By contrast, for the squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC) there were no statistically significant MEGs as either stage or risk level advanced. CONCLUSIONS The pathologic stage of non-small cell lung cancer patients at early stages has no prognostic value, making the identification of prognostic gene signatures for them more meaningful and highly desirable.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bader, Gary D</author><author>Cary, Michael P</author><author>Sander, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pathguide: a pathway resource list.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title></periodical><pages>D504-6</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>Database issue</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16381921</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkj126</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - Bader, Cary, Sander - Unknown - Pathguide a Pathway Resource List.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.biopax.org</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16381921</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC1347488</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Pathguide: the Pathway Resource List (http://pathguide.org) is a meta-database that provides an overview of more than 190 web-accessible biological pathway and network databases.

We performed prospective targeted sequencing of 1,134 CRCs. We identified splice alterations in intronic regions of APC and large in-frame deletions in CTNNB1, increasing oncogenic WNT pathway alterations to 96% of CRCs. Right-sided primary site in microsatellite stable mCRC was associated with shorter survival, older age at diagnosis, increased mutations, and enrichment of oncogenic alterations in KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT1, RNF43, and SMAD4 compared with left-sided primaries. Left-sided tumors frequently had no identifiable genetic alteration in mitogenic signaling, but exhibited higher mitogenic ligand expression. Our results suggest different pathways to tumorigenesis in right- and left-sided microsatellite stable CRC that may underlie clinical differences.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bailey, Matthew H</author><author>Tokheim, Collin</author><author>Porta-Pardo, Eduard</author><author>Sengupta, Sohini</author><author>Bertrand, Denis</author><author>Weerasinghe, Amila</author><author>Colaprico, Antonio</author><author>Wendl, Michael C</author><author>Kim, Jaegil</author><author>Reardon, Brendan</author><author>Kwok-Shing Ng, Patrick</author><author>Jeong, Kang Jin</author><author>Cao, Song</author><author>Wang, Zixing</author><author>Gao, Jianjiong</author><author>Gao, Qingsong</author><author>Wang, Fang</author><author>Liu, Eric Minwei</author><author>Mularoni, Loris</author><author>Rubio-Perez, Carlota</author><author>Nagarajan, Niranjan</author><author>Cortés-Ciriano, Isidro</author><author>Zhou, Daniel Cui</author><author>Liang, Wen-Wei</author><author>Hess, Julian M</author><author>Yellapantula, Venkata D</author><author>Tamborero, David</author><author>Gonzalez-Perez, Abel</author><author>Suphavilai, Chayaporn</author><author>Ko, Jia Yu</author><author>Khurana, Ekta</author><author>Park, Peter J</author><author>Van Allen, Eliezer M</author><author>Liang, Han</author><author>MC3 Working Group</author><author>Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network</author><author>Lawrence, Michael S</author><author>Godzik, Adam</author><author>Lopez-Bigas, Nuria</author><author>Stuart, Josh</author><author>Wheeler, David</author><author>Getz, Gad</author><author>Chen, Ken</author><author>Lazar, Alexander J</author><author>Mills, Gordon B</author><author>Karchin, Rachel</author><author>Ding, Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comprehensive Characterization of Cancer Driver Genes and Mutations.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>1034-1035</pages><volume>174</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>driver gene discovery</keyword><keyword>mutations of clinical relevance</keyword><keyword>oncology</keyword><keyword>structure analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><isbn>10974172 (Electronic)</isbn><accession-num>30096302</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2018.07.034</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Bailey et al. - Cell - Comprehensive Characterization of Cancer Driver Genes and Mutations.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17332521</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4727746</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30096302</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We have previously shown that 7B2 null mice on the 129/SvEvTac (129) genetic background die at 5 weeks of age with hypercorticosteronemia due to a Cushing's-like disease unless they are rescued by adrenalectomy; however, 7B2 nulls on the C57BL/6NTac (B6) background remain healthy, with normal steroid levels. Since background exerts such a profound influence on the phenotype of this mutation, we have evaluated whether these two different mouse strains respond differently to high circulating steroids by chronically treating wild-type 129 and B6 mice with the synthetic steroid dexamethasone (Dex). Dex treatment decreased the dopamine content of the neurointermediate lobes (NIL) of 129 mice, leading to NIL enlargement and increased total D(2)R mRNA in the 129, but not the B6, NIL. Despite the decrease in this inhibitory transmitter, Dex-treated 129 mice exhibited reduced circulating alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) along with reduced POMC-derived peptides compared with controls, possibly due to reduced POMC content in the NIL. In contrast, Dex-treated B6 mice showed lowered cellular ACTH, unchanged alpha-MSH and beta-endorphin, and increased circulating alpha-MSH, most likely due to increased cleavage of NIL ACTH by increased PC2. Dex-treated 129 mice exhibited hyperinsulinemia and lowered blood glucose, whereas Dex-treated B6 mice showed slightly increased glucose levels despite their considerably increased insulin levels. Taken together, our results suggest that the endocrinological response of 129 mice to chronic Dex treatment is very different from that of B6 mice. These strain-dependent differences in steroid sensitivity must be taken into account when comparing different lines of transgenic or knockout mice.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, Ting</author><author>Lavoie, Hugo</author><author>Sahmi, Malha</author><author>David, Maud</author><author>Hilt, Christine</author><author>Hammell, Amy</author><author>Therrien, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RAF inhibitors promote RAS-RAF interaction by allosterically disrupting RAF autoinhibition.</title><secondary-title>Nature communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1211</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><accession-num>29084939</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-017-01274-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Unknown - Jin et al. - Unknown - RAF inhibitors promote RAS-RAF interaction by allosterically disrupting RAF autoinhibition.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.nature.com/naturecommunications</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29084939</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5662619</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>First-generation RAF inhibitors paradoxically induce ERK signaling in normal and tumor cells exhibiting RAS activity. Compound-induced RAF dimerization through stabilization of the RAF ON/active state by inhibitors has emerged as a critical contributing factor. RAF inhibitors also enhance RAS-RAF association. Although this event is thought to play a key role in priming RAF activation, the underlying mechanism is not known. Here we report that RAF inhibitors induce the disruption of intramolecular interactions between the kinase domain and its N-terminal regulatory region independently of RAS activity. This provides a molecular basis to explain the induction of RAS-RAF association by RAF inhibitors, as well as the co-operativity observed between RAS activity and RAF kinase inhibitors in driving RAF activation. Profiling of second-generation RAF inhibitors confirmed their improved mode of action, but also revealed liabilities that allowed us to discern two properties of an ideal RAF inhibitor: high-binding affinity to all RAF paralogs and maintenance of the OFF/autoinhibited state of the enzyme.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nussinov, Ruth</author><author>Tsai, Chung-Jung</author><author>Jang, Hyunbum</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Is Nanoclustering essential for all oncogenic KRas pathways?

Both pathways are needed in KRAS-driven proliferation. Here we ask: Is oncogenic KRas nanoclustering (or dimerization) essential for all KRas signaling pathways? Raf kinase domain dimerization, thus MAPK activation, requires KRas nanoclusters. By contrast, the PI3Kα heterodimer acts as a monomeric unit; thus, does PI3Kα activation and PI3Kα/Akt/mTOR signaling require nanoclustering? Further, calmodulin binds only to oncogenic KRas4B. Here we ask: Does calmodulin downregulate KRas4B cancer development as suggested early on, or promote it? We also ask: Why is oncogenic KRas4B the most abundant isoform? Does wild-type Ras indeed inhibit its oncogenic variants as data appeared to suggest? And related to the last question, why is wild-type KRas a more potent inhibitor of its oncogenic form than wild-type NRas of its oncogenic form? Resolving these cardinal questions, and others, such as how exactly does RASSF5 (NORE1A) act as tumor suppressor, and why Ras isoforms tend to occur in distinct cancer types are crucial for effective pharmacology. In this review, we take a nanoclustering/dimerization-centric outlook and show that many questions can be explained by simply considering Ras nanoclustering.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schneider, Günter</author><author>Schmidt-Supprian, Marc</author><author>Rad, Roland</author><author>Saur, Dieter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tissue-specific tumorigenesis: context matters.</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

Traditionally, tumours from the same anatomical site are treated as one tumour entity. This concept has been challenged by recent breakthroughs in cancer genomics and translational research that have enabled molecular tumour profiling. The identification and validation of cancer drivers that are shared between different tumour types, spurred the new paradigm to target driver pathways across anatomical sites by off-label drug use, or within so-called basket or umbrella trials which are designed to test whether molecular alterations in one tumour entity can be extrapolated to all others. However, recent clinical and preclinical studies suggest that there are tissue- and cell type-specific differences in tumorigenesis and the organization of oncogenic signalling pathways. In this Opinion article, we focus on the molecular, cellular, systemic and environmental determinants of organ-specific tumorigenesis and the mechanisms of context-specific oncogenic signalling outputs. Investigation, recognition and in-depth biological understanding of these differences will be vital for the design of next-generation clinical trials and the implementation of molecularly guided cancer therapies in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raphael, Benjamin J</author><author>Dobson, Jason R</author><author>Oesper, Layla</author><author>Vandin, Fabio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying driver mutations in sequenced cancer genomes: computational approaches to enable precision medicine.</title><secondary-title>Genome medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>5</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1756-994X (Electronic) 1756-994X (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>24479672</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/gm524</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2014 - Raphael et al. - Genome medicine - Identifying driver mutations in sequenced cancer genomes computational approaches to enable pr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://genomemedicine.com/content/6/1/5</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479672</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3978567</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>High-throughput DNA sequencing is revolutionizing the study of cancer and enabling the measurement of the somatic mutations that drive cancer development. However, the resulting sequencing datasets are large and complex, obscuring the clinically important mutations in a background of errors, noise, and random mutations. Here, we review computational approaches to identify somatic mutations in cancer genome sequences and to distinguish the driver mutations that are responsible for cancer from random, passenger mutations. First, we describe approaches to detect somatic mutations from high-throughput DNA sequencing data, particularly for tumor samples that comprise heterogeneous populations of cells. Next, we review computational approaches that aim to predict driver mutations according to their frequency of occurrence in a cohort of samples, or according to their predicted functional impact on protein sequence or structure. Finally, we review techniques to identify recurrent combinations of somatic mutations, including approaches that examine mutations in known pathways or protein-interaction networks, as well as de novo approaches that identify combinations of mutations according to statistical patterns of mutual exclusivity. These techniques, coupled with advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing, are enabling precision medicine approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Simanshu, Dhirendra K</author><author>Nissley, Dwight V</author><author>McCormick, Frank</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RAS Proteins and Their Regulators in Human Disease.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>17-33</pages><volume>170</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>CRAFT</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>KRAS therapies</keyword><keyword>NF1</keyword><keyword>RAF1</keyword><keyword>RAS effectors</keyword><keyword>RAS in the membrane</keyword><keyword>RAS proteins</keyword><keyword>RAS-driven cancer</keyword><keyword>RASopathies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><isbn>1097-4172 (Electronic) 0092-8674 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>28666118</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2017.06.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2017 - Simanshu, Nissley, McCormick - Cell - RAS Proteins and Their Regulators in Human Disease.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.06.009</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28666118</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5555610</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>RAS proteins are binary switches, cycling between ON and OFF states during signal transduction. These switches are normally tightly controlled, but in RAS-related diseases, such as cancer, RASopathies, and many psychiatric disorders, mutations in the RAS genes or their regulators render RAS proteins persistently active. The structural basis of the switch and many of the pathways that RAS controls are well known, but the precise mechanisms by which RAS proteins function are less clear. All RAS biology occurs in membranes: a precise understanding of RAS' interaction with membranes is essential to understand RAS action and to intervene in RAS-driven diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Waters, Andrew M</author><author>Der, Channing J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>KRAS: The Critical Driver and Therapeutic Target for Pancreatic Cancer.</title><secondary-title>Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>29229669</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/cshperspect.a031435</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Waters, Der - Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine - KRAS The Critical Driver and Therapeutic Target for Pancreatic Cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27096871</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4846854</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29229669</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC5995645</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) comprise the most frequently mutated oncogene family in human cancer. With the highest RAS mutation frequencies seen with the top three causes of cancer deaths in the United States (lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer), the development of anti-RAS therapies is a major priority for cancer research. Despite more than three decades of intense effort, no effective RAS inhibitors have yet to reach the cancer patient. With bitter lessons learned from past failures and with new ideas and strategies, there is renewed hope that undruggable RAS may finally be conquered. With the KRAS isoform mutated in 84% of all RAS-mutant cancers, we focus on KRAS. With a near 100% KRAS mutation frequency, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered the most RAS-addicted of all cancers. We review the role of KRAS as a driver and therapeutic target in PDAC.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Bingying</author><author>Der, Channing J</author><author>Cox, Adrienne D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of wild type RAS isoforms in cancer.</title><secondary-title>Seminars in cell &amp; developmental biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Seminars in cell &amp; developmental biology</full-title></periodical><pages>60-9</pages><volume>58</volume><keywords><keyword>Cancer</keyword><keyword>Isoform</keyword><keyword>Mutant</keyword><keyword>RAS</keyword><keyword>RASGAP</keyword><keyword>Wild type</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>8133822076</isbn><accession-num>27422332</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.semcdb.2016.07.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2016 - Zhou, Der, Cox - Seminars in cell &amp; developmental biology - The role of wild type RAS isoforms in cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17332521</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4727746</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30096302</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422332</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?ar</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Mutationally activated RAS proteins are critical oncogenic drivers in nearly 30% of all human cancers. As with mutant RAS, the role of wild type RAS proteins in oncogenesis, tumour maintenance and metastasis is context-dependent. Complexity is introduced by the existence of multiple RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, NRAS) and protein &quot;isoforms&quot; (KRAS4A, KRAS4B), by the ever more complicated network of RAS signaling, and by the increasing identification of numerous genetic aberrations in cancers that do and do not harbour mutant RAS. Numerous mouse model carcinogenesis studies and examination of patient tumours reveal that, in RAS-mutant cancers, wild type RAS proteins are likely to serve as tumour suppressors when the mutant RAS is of the same isoform. This evidence is particularly robust in KRAS mutant cancers, which often display suppression or loss of wild type KRAS, but is not as strong for NRAS. In contrast, although not yet fully elucidated, the preponderance of evidence indicates that wild type RAS proteins play a tumour promoting role when the mutant RAS is of a different isoform. In non-RAS mutant cancers, wild type RAS is recognized as a mediator of oncogenic signaling due to chronic activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases that feed through RAS. Additionally, in the absence of mutant RAS, activation of wild type RAS may drive cancer upon the loss of negative RAS regulators such as NF1 GAP or SPRY proteins. Here we explore the current state of knowledge with respect to the roles of wild type RAS proteins in human cancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zou, James</author><author>Huss, Mikael</author><author>Abid, Abubakar</author><author>Mohammadi, Pejman</author><author>Torkamani, Ali</author><author>Telenti, Amalio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A primer on deep learning in genomics.</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>12-18</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><accession-num>30478442</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41588-018-0295-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2019 - Zou et al. - Nature genetics - A primer on deep learning in genomics.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0295-5</url><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0295-5</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30478442</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Deep learning methods are a class of machine learning techniques capable of identifying highly complex patterns in large datasets.

Despite declining incidence and mortality rates in recent years, there is still a significant number of cases that are metastatic at presentation. Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy was the backbone of colorectal cancer treatment, but the addition of irinotecan and oxaliplatin to form combination regimens has significantly improved overall survival. In the past decade, the development of novel biologic agents including therapies directed against vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor has further altered the landscape of metastatic colorectal cancer treatment. However, clinical trials have demonstrated that not all patients respond to these therapies similarly and consideration must be given to individual patient- and tumor-related factors. A more tailored and biomarker driven approach to treatment selection can optimize outcomes and avoid unnecessary adverse effects. In this review article, we offer a comprehensive overview of the panel of clinical- and tumor-associated characteristics that influence treatment decisions in metastatic colorectal cancer and how this sets the foundation for a more personalized treatment strategy in oncology.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balmanno, Kathryn</author><author>Chell, Simon D.</author><author>Gillings, Annette S.</author><author>Hayat, Shaista</author><author>Cook, Simon J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intrinsic resistance to the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) is associated with weak ERK1/2 signalling and/or strong PI3K signalling in colorectal cancer cell lines</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>2332-2341</pages><volume>125</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>BRAF</keyword><keyword>Colorectal cancer</keyword><keyword>ERK1/2</keyword><keyword>KRAS</keyword><keyword>PI3K</keyword><keyword>PTEN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19637312</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ijc.24604</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Balmanno_et_al-2009-International_Journal_of_Cancer.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Mutations in KRAS or BRAF frequently manifest in constitutive activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signalling pathway. The MEK1/2-selective inhibitor, AZD6244 (ARRY-142886), blocks ERK1/2 activation and is currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Tumour cells can vary markedly in their response to MAPK or ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, and the presence of a BRAF mutation is thought to predict sensitivity, with the RAS mutations being associated with intrinsic resistance. We analysed cell proliferation in a panel of 19 colorectal cancer cell lines and found no simple correlation between BRAF or KRAS mutation and sensitivity to AZD6244, though cells that harbour neither mutation tended to be resistant. Cells that were sensitive arrested in G(1) and/or underwent apoptosis and the presence of BRAF or KRAS mutation was not sufficient to predict either fate. Cell lines that were resistant to AZD6244 exhibited low or no ERK1/2 activation or exhibited coincident activation of ERK1/2 and protein kinase B (PKB), the latter indicative of activation of the PI3K pathway. In cell lines with coincident ERK1/2 and PKB activation, sensitivity to AZD6244 could be re-imposed by any of the 3 distinct PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. We conclude that AZD6244 is effective in colorectal cancer cell lines with BRAF or KRAS mutations. Sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition correlates with a biochemical signature; those cells with high ERK1/2 activity (whether mutant for BRAF or KRAS) evolve a dependency upon that pathway and tend to be sensitive to AZD6244 but this can be offset by high PI3K-dependent signalling. This may have implications for the use of MEK inhibitors in combination with PI3K inhibitors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_library.enl" path="mendeley_library.enl">mendeley_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ofir Dovrat, Tali</author><author>Sokol, Ethan</author><author>Frampton, Garrett</author><author>Shachar, Eliya</author><author>Pelles, Sharon</author><author>Geva, Ravit</author><author>Wolf, Ido</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unusually long-term responses to vemurafenib in BRAF V600E mutated colon and thyroid cancers followed by the development of rare RAS activating mutations.</title><secondary-title>Cancer biology &amp; therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer biology &amp; therapy</full-title></periodical><pages>871-874</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>RAF V600E</keyword><keyword>RAS</keyword><keyword>colon cancer</keyword><keyword>thyroid cancer</keyword><keyword>vemurafenib</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><accession-num>30036146</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/15384047.2018.1480289</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2018 - Dovrat et al. - Unknown - Unusually long-term responses to vemurafenib in BRAF V600E mutated colon and thyroid cancers followed b.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1080/15384047.2018.1480289</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036146</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC6300338</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>INTRODUCTION V600E BRAF mutation is an established driver mutation in a variety of tumors. Vemurafenib is a selective inhibitor of the BRAF V600E kinase, known to be highly effective in BRAF V600E-positive metastatic melanoma. As a single agent, vemurafenib is relatively ineffective in other V600E-positive malignancies. Case 1: A 72 year old man with metastatic CRC who failed several previous lines of chemotherapy. Genetic analysis of 315 cancer-related genes (Foundation Medicine, FMI) revealed a BRAF V600E mutation. The patient was treated with vemurafenib resulting in a partial response of 18 months. Genetic analysis following development of resistance revealed a new mutation in KRAS-G12R. Case 2: V600E mutation was identified in a 59 year old woman with metastatic PTC refractory to radioiodine therapy. The patient was treated with vemurafenib resulting in a partial response lasting 43 months. Genetic analysis following development of resistance revealed a new mutation in NRAS-Q61K. The presented cases demonstrated the development of rare RAS mutations as a genetic mechanism of acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance. This observation is strongly supported by the analysis of a large database consisting of 712 BRAF V600E-positive melanoma samples showing higher rates of BRAF V600E and RAS mutations co-occurrence in metastatic lesions compared to local tumors (OR = 3.8, p = 0.035). This enrichment is likely a result of the development of RAS mutations following treatment with BRAF inhibitors. DISCUSSION We report two cases showing extreme response to vemurafenib, which could not be predicted prior to treatment commencement. Genetic testing demonstrated a resistant mechanism not previously reported in CRC or PTC patients, namely an acquired mutation of RAS. This is supported by an analysis of a large cohort of BRAF V600E-positive melanomas. Further studies are needed in order to identify predictive markers for response to vemurafenib and to explore novel strategies to overcome RAS-mediated resistance.</abstract></record></records></xml>
